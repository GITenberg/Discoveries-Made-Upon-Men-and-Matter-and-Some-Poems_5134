INTRODUCTION<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ben Jonson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Discoveries&rdquo; are, as he says in the
few Latin words prefixed to them, &ldquo;A wood - Sylva - of things
and thoughts, in Greek &ldquo;&upsilon;&lambda;&eta;&rdquo; [which has
for its first meaning material, but is also applied peculiarly to kinds
of wood, and to a wood], &ldquo;from the multiplicity and variety of
the material contained in it.&nbsp; For, as we are commonly used to
call the infinite mixed multitude of growing trees a wood, so the ancients
gave the name of Sylv&aelig; - Timber Trees - to books of theirs in
which small works of various and diverse matter were promiscuously brought
together.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In this little book we have some of the best thoughts of one of the
most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature.&nbsp;
The songs added are a part of what Ben Jonson called his &ldquo;Underwoods.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Ben Jonson was of a north-country family from the Annan district that
produced Thomas Carlyle.&nbsp; His father was ruined by religious persecution
in the reign of Mary, became a preacher in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign,
and died a month before the poet&rsquo;s birth in 1573.&nbsp; Ben Jonson,
therefore, was about nine years younger than Shakespeare, and he survived
Shakespeare about twenty-one years, dying in August, 1637.&nbsp; Next
to Shakespeare Ben Jonson was, in his own different way, the man of
most mark in the story of the English drama.&nbsp; His mother, left
poor, married again.&nbsp; Her second husband was a bricklayer, or small
builder, and they lived for a time near Charing Cross in Hartshorn Lane.&nbsp;
Ben Jonson was taught at the parish school of St. Martin&rsquo;s till
he was discovered by William Camden, the historian.&nbsp; Camden was
then second master in Westminster School.&nbsp; He procured for young
Ben an admission into his school, and there laid firm foundations for
that scholarship which the poet extended afterwards by private study
until his learning grew to be sworn-brother to his wit.<br>
<br>
Ben Jonson began the world poor.&nbsp; He worked for a very short time
in his step-father&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; He volunteered to the wars
in the Low Countries.&nbsp; He came home again, and joined the players.&nbsp;
Before the end of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign he had written three or four
plays, in which he showed a young and ardent zeal for setting the world
to rights, together with that high sense of the poet&rsquo;s calling
which put lasting force into his work.&nbsp; He poured contempt on those
who frittered life away.&nbsp; He urged on the poetasters and the mincing
courtiers, who set their hearts on top-knots and affected movements
of their lips and legs:-<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That these vain joys in which their wills consume<br>
Such powers of wit and soul as are of force<br>
To raise their beings to eternity,<br>
May be converted on works fitting men;<br>
And for the practice of a forc&eacute;d look,<br>
An antic gesture, or a fustian phrase,<br>
Study the native frame of a true heart,<br>
An inward comeliness of bounty, knowledge,<br>
And spirit that may conform them actually<br>
To God&rsquo;s high figures, which they have in power.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Ben Jonson&rsquo;s genius was producing its best work in the earlier
years of the reign of James I.&nbsp; His <i>Volpone</i>,<i> </i>the
<i>Silent Woman</i>,<i> </i>and the <i>Alchemist </i>first appeared
side by side with some of the ripest works of Shakespeare in the years
from 1605 to 1610.&nbsp; In the latter part of James&rsquo;s reign he
produced masques for the Court, and turned with distaste from the public
stage.&nbsp; When Charles I. became king, Ben Jonson was weakened in
health by a paralytic stroke.&nbsp; He returned to the stage for a short
time through necessity, but found his best friends in the best of the
young poets of the day.&nbsp; These looked up to him as their father
and their guide.&nbsp; Their own best efforts seemed best to them when
they had won Ben Jonson&rsquo;s praise.&nbsp; They valued above all
passing honours man could give the words, &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; in the
old poet&rsquo;s greeting, which, as they said, &ldquo;sealed them of
the tribe of Ben.&rdquo;<br>

DISCOVERIES MADE UPON MEN AND MATTER,<br>
AS THEY HAVE FLOWED OUT OF HIS DAILY READINGS,<br>
OR HAD THEIR REFLUX TO HIS PECULIAR<br>
NOTION OF THE TIMES.<br>
<br>
<i>Tecum habita</i>,<i> ut n&ocirc;ris quam sit tibi curta supellex</i>
<a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11">{11}</a><br>
PERS.&nbsp; Sat. 4.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Fortuna.</i> - Ill fortune never crushed that man whom good fortune
deceived not.&nbsp; I therefore have counselled my friends never to
trust to her fairer side, though she seemed to make peace with them;
but to place all things she gave them, so as she might ask them again
without their trouble, she might take them from them, not pull them:
to keep always a distance between her and themselves.&nbsp; He knows
not his own strength that hath not met adversity.&nbsp; Heaven prepares
good men with crosses; but no ill can happen to a good man.&nbsp; Contraries
are not mixed.&nbsp; Yet that which happens to any man may to every
man.&nbsp; But it is in his reason, what he accounts it and will make
it.<br>
<br>
<i>Casus.</i> - Change into extremity is very frequent and easy.&nbsp;
As when a beggar suddenly grows rich, he commonly becomes a prodigal;
for, to obscure his former obscurity, he puts on riot and excess.<br>
<br>
<i>Consilia.</i> - No man is so foolish but may give another good counsel
sometimes; and no man is so wise but may easily err, if he will take
no others&rsquo; counsel but his own.&nbsp; But very few men are wise
by their own counsel, or learned by their own teaching.&nbsp; For he
that was only taught by himself <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12">{12}</a>
had a fool to his master.<br>
<br>
<i>Fama</i>. - A Fame that is wounded to the world would be better cured
by another&rsquo;s apology than its own: for few can apply medicines
well themselves.&nbsp; Besides, the man that is once hated, both his
good and his evil deeds oppress him.&nbsp; He is not easily emergent.<br>
<br>
<i>Negotia</i>. - In great affairs it is a work of difficulty to please
all.&nbsp; And ofttimes we lose the occasions of carrying a business
well and thoroughly by our too much haste.&nbsp; For passions are spiritual
rebels, and raise sedition against the understanding.<br>
<br>
<i>Amor patri&aelig;</i>. - There is a necessity all men should love
their country: he that professeth the contrary may be delighted with
his words, but his heart is there.<br>
<br>
<i>Ingenia</i>. - Natures that are hardened to evil you shall sooner
break than make straight; they are like poles that are crooked and dry,
there is no attempting them.<br>
<br>
<i>Applausus</i>. - We praise the things we hear with much more willingness
than those we see, because we envy the present and reverence the past;
thinking ourselves instructed by the one, and overlaid by the other.<br>
<br>
<i>Opinio</i>. - Opinion is a light, vain, crude, and imperfect thing;
settled in the imagination, but never arriving at the understanding,
there to obtain the tincture of reason.&nbsp; We labour with it more
than truth.&nbsp; There is much more holds us than presseth us.&nbsp;
An ill fact is one thing, an ill fortune is another; yet both oftentimes
sway us alike, by the error of our thinking.<br>
<br>
<i>Impostura</i>. - Many men believe not themselves what they would
persuade others; and less do the things which they would impose on others;
but least of all know what they themselves most confidently boast.&nbsp;
Only they set the sign of the cross over their outer doors, and sacrifice
to their gut and their groin in their inner closets.<br>
<br>
<i>Jactura vit&aelig;</i>. - What a deal of cold business doth a man
misspend the better part of life in! in scattering compliments, tendering
visits, gathering and venting news, following feasts and plays, making
a little winter-love in a dark corner.<br>
<br>
Hypocrita<i>.</i> - <i>Puritanus Hypocrita est H&aelig;reticus</i>,<i>
quem opinio propri&aelig; perspicaci&aelig;</i>,<i> qu&acirc; sibi videtur</i>,<i>
cum paucis in Ecclesi&acirc; dogmatibus errores quosdam animadvertisse</i>,<i>
de statu mentis deturbavit: unde sacro furore percitus</i>,<i> phrenetice
pugnat contra magistratus</i>,<i> sic ratus obedientiam pr&aelig;stare
Deo</i>. <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14">{14}</a><br>
<br>
<i>Mutua auxilia.</i> - Learning needs rest: sovereignty gives it.&nbsp;
Sovereignty needs counsel: learning affords it.&nbsp; There is such
a consociation of offices between the prince and whom his favour breeds,
that they may help to sustain his power as he their knowledge.&nbsp;
It is the greatest part of his liberality, his favour; and from whom
doth he hear discipline more willingly, or the arts discoursed more
gladly, than from those whom his own bounty and benefits have made able
and faithful?<br>
<br>
<i>Cognit. univers</i>. - In being able to counsel others, a man must
be furnished with a universal store in himself, to the knowledge of
all nature - that is, the matter and seed-plot: there are the seats
of all argument and invention.&nbsp; But especially you must be cunning
in the nature of man: there is the variety of things which are as the
elements and letters, which his art and wisdom must rank and order to
the present occasion.&nbsp; For we see not all letters in single words,
nor all places in particular discourses.&nbsp; That cause seldom happens
wherein a man will use all arguments.<br>
<br>
<i>Consiliarii adjunct.&nbsp; Probitas</i>,<i> Sapientia.</i> - The
two chief things that give a man reputation in counsel are the opinion
of his honesty and the opinion of his wisdom: the authority of those
two will persuade when the same counsels uttered by other persons less
qualified are of no efficacy or working.<br>
<br>
<i>Vita recta.</i> - Wisdom without honesty is mere craft and cozenage.&nbsp;
And therefore the reputation of honesty must first be gotten, which
cannot be but by living well.&nbsp; A good life is a main argument.<br>
<br>
<i>Obsequentia.</i> - <i>Humanitas.</i> - <i>Solicitudo.</i> - Next
a good life, to beget love in the persons we counsel, by dissembling
our knowledge of ability in ourselves, and avoiding all suspicion of
arrogance, ascribing all to their instruction, as an ambassador to his
master, or a subject to his sovereign; seasoning all with humanity and
sweetness, only expressing care and solicitude.&nbsp; And not to counsel
rashly, or on the sudden, but with advice and meditation.&nbsp; (<i>Dat
nox consilium</i>. <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a">{17a}</a>)&nbsp;
For many foolish things fall from wise men, if they speak in haste or
be extemporal.&nbsp; It therefore behoves the giver of counsel to be
circumspect; especially to beware of those with whom he is not thoroughly
acquainted, lest any spice of rashness, folly, or self-love appear,
which will be marked by new persons and men of experience in affairs.<br>
<br>
<i>Modestia</i>. - <i>Parrhesia</i>. - And to the prince, or his superior,
to behave himself modestly and with respect.&nbsp; Yet free from flattery
or empire.&nbsp; Not with insolence or precept; but as the prince were
already furnished with the parts he should have, especially in affairs
of state.&nbsp; For in other things they will more easily suffer themselves
to be taught or reprehended: they will not willingly contend, but hear,
with Alexander, the answer the musician gave him: <i>Absit</i>,<i> o
rex</i>,<i> ut tu meli&ugrave;s h&aelig;c scias</i>,<i> qu&agrave;m
ego. </i><a name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b">{17b}</a><br>
<br>
<i>Perspicuitas.</i> - <i>Elegantia.</i> - A man should so deliver himself
to the nature of the subject whereof he speaks, that his hearer may
take knowledge of his discipline with some delight; and so apparel fair
and good matter, that the studious of elegancy be not defrauded; redeem
arts from their rough and braky seats, where they lay hid and overgrown
with thorns, to a pure, open, and flowery light, where they may take
the eye and be taken by the hand.<br>
<br>
<i>Natura non eff&aelig;ta</i>. - I cannot think Nature is so spent
and decayed that she can bring forth nothing worth her former years.&nbsp;
She is always the same, like herself; and when she collects her strength
is abler still.&nbsp; Men are decayed, and studies: she is not.<br>
<br>
<i>Non nimi&ugrave;m credendum antiquitati</i>. - I know nothing can
conduce more to letters than to examine the writings of the ancients,
and not to rest in their sole authority, or take all upon trust from
them, provided the plagues of judging and pronouncing against them be
away; such as are envy, bitterness, precipitation, impudence, and scurrilous
scoffing.&nbsp; For to all the observations of the ancients we have
our own experience, which if we will use and apply, we have better means
to pronounce.&nbsp; It is true they opened the gates, and made the way
that went before us, but as guides, not commanders: <i>Non domini nostri</i>,<i>
sed duces fu&ecirc;re</i>. <a name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a">{19a}</a>&nbsp;
 Truth lies open to all; it is no man&rsquo;s several.&nbsp; <i>Patet
omnibus veritas</i>;<i> nondum est occupata.&nbsp; Multum ex ill&acirc;</i>,<i>
etiam futuris relicta est</i>. <a name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b">{19b}</a><br>
<br>
<i>Dissentire licet</i>,<i> sed cum ratione.</i> - If in some things
I dissent from others, whose wit, industry, diligence, and judgment,
I look up at and admire, let me not therefore hear presently of ingratitude
and rashness.&nbsp; For I thank those that have taught me, and will
ever; but yet dare not think the scope of their labour and inquiry was
to envy their posterity what they also could add and find out.<br>
<br>
<i>Non mihi credendum sed veritati</i>. - If I err, pardon me: <i>Nulla
ars simul et inventa est et absoluta</i>. <a name="citation19c"></a><a href="#footnote19c">{19c}</a>&nbsp;
I do not desire to be equal to those that went before; but to have my
reason examined with theirs, and so much faith to be given them, or
me, as those shall evict.&nbsp; I am neither author nor fautor of any
sect.&nbsp; I will have no man addict himself to me; but if I have anything
right, defend it as Truth&rsquo;s, not mine, save as it conduceth to
a common good.&nbsp; It profits not me to have any man fence or fight
for me, to flourish, or take my side.&nbsp; Stand for truth, and &lsquo;tis
enough.<br>
<br>
<i>Scienti&aelig; liberales</i>. - Arts that respect the mind were ever
reputed nobler than those that serve the body, though we less can be
without them, as tillage, spinning, weaving, building, &amp;c., without
which we could scarce sustain life a day.&nbsp; But these were the works
of every hand; the other of the brain only, and those the most generous
and exalted wits and spirits, that cannot rest or acquiesce.&nbsp; The
mind of man is still fed with labour: <i>Opere pascitur.<br>
<br>
Non vulgi sunt</i>. - There is a more secret cause, and the power of
liberal studies lies more hid than that it can be wrought out by profane
wits.&nbsp; It is not every man&rsquo;s way to hit.&nbsp; There are
men, I confess, that set the carat and value upon things as they love
them; but science is not every man&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp; It is as
great a spite to be praised in the wrong place, and by a wrong person,
as can be done to a noble nature.<br>
<br>
<i>Honesta ambitio</i>. - If divers men seek fame or honour by divers
ways, so both be honest, neither is to be blamed; but they that seek
immortality are not only worthy of love, but of praise.<br>
<br>
<i>Maritus improbus</i>. - He hath a delicate wife, a fair fortune,
a family to go to and be welcome; yet he had rather be drunk with mine
host and the fiddlers of such a town, than go home.<br>
<br>
<i>Afflictio pia magistra</i>. - Affliction teacheth a wicked person
some time to pray: prosperity never.<br>
<br>
<i>Deploratis facilis descensus Averni</i>. - <i>The devil take all</i>.
- Many might go to heaven with half the labour they go to hell, if they
would venture their industry the right way; but &ldquo;The devil take
all!&rdquo; quoth he that was choked in the mill-dam, with his four
last words in his mouth.<br>
<br>
<i>&AElig;gidius cursu superat.</i> - A cripple in the way out-travels
a footman or a post out of the way.<br>
<br>
<i>Prodigo nummi nauci</i>. - Bags of money to a prodigal person are
the same that cherry-stones are with some boys, and so thrown away.<br>
<br>
<i>Munda et sordida</i>. - A woman, the more curious she is about her
face is commonly the more careless about her house.<br>
<br>
<i>Debitum deploratum</i>. - Of this spilt water there is a little to
be gathered up: it is a desperate debt.<br>
<br>
<i>Latro sesquipedalis.</i> - The thief <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22">{22}</a>
that had a longing at the gallows to commit one robbery more before
he was hanged.<br>
<br>
And like the German lord, when he went out of Newgate into the cart,
took order to have his arms set up in his last herborough: said was
he taken and committed upon suspicion of treason, no witness appearing
against him; but the judges entertained him most civilly, discoursed
with him, offered him the courtesy of the rack; but he confessed, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
<i>Calumni&aelig; fructus</i>. - I am beholden to calumny, that she
hath so endeavoured and taken pains to belie me.&nbsp; It shall make
me set a surer guard on myself, and keep a better watch upon my actions.<br>
<br>
<i>Impertinens</i>. - A tedious person is one a man would leap a steeple
from, gallop down any steep lull to avoid him; forsake his meat, sleep,
nature itself, with all her benefits, to shun him.&nbsp; A mere impertinent;
one that touched neither heaven nor earth in his discourse.&nbsp; He
opened an entry into a fair room, but shut it again presently.&nbsp;
I spoke to him of garlic, he answered asparagus; consulted him of marriage,
he tells me of hanging, as if they went by one and the same destiny.<br>
<br>
<i>Bellum scribentium</i>. - What a sight it is to see writers committed
together by the ears for ceremonies, syllables, points, colons, commas,
hyphens, and the like, fighting as for their fires and their altars;
and angry that none are frighted at their noises and loud brayings under
their asses&rsquo; skins.<br>
<br>
There is hope of getting a fortune without digging in these quarries.&nbsp;
<i>Sed meliore (in omne) ingenio animoque qu&agrave;m fortun&acirc;</i>,<i>
sum usus. </i><a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23">{23}</a><br>
<br>
&ldquo;Pingue solum lassat; sed juvat ipse labor.&rdquo; <a name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a">{24a}</a><br>
<br>
<i>Differentia inter doctos et sciolos</i>. - Wits made out their several
expeditions then for the discovery of truth, to find out great and profitable
knowledges; had their several instruments for the disquisition of arts.&nbsp;
Now there are certain scioli or smatterers that are busy in the skirts
and outsides of learning, and have scarce anything of solid literature
to commend them.&nbsp; They may have some edging or trimming of a scholar,
a welt or so; but it is no more.<br>
<br>
<i>Impostorum fucus.</i> - Imposture is a specious thing, yet never
worse than when it feigns to be best, and to none discovered sooner
than the simplest.&nbsp; For truth and goodness are plain and open;
but imposture is ever ashamed of the light.<br>
<br>
<i>Icunculorum motio</i>. - A puppet-play must be shadowed and seen
in the dark; for draw the curtain, <i>et sordet gesticulatio. </i><a name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b">{24b}</a><br>
<br>
<i>Principes et administri.</i> - There is a great difference in the
understanding of some princes, as in the quality of their ministers
about them.&nbsp; Some would dress their masters in gold, pearl, and
all true jewels of majesty; others furnish them with feathers, bells,
and ribands, and are therefore esteemed the fitter servants.&nbsp; But
they are ever good men that must make good the times; if the men be
naught, the times will be such.&nbsp; <i>Finis exspectandus est in unoquoque
hominum; animali ad mutationem promptissmo</i>. <a name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a">{25a}</a><br>
<br>
<i>Scitum Hispanicum</i>. - It is a quick saying with the Spaniards,
<i>Artes inter h&aelig;redes non dividi</i>. <a name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b">{25b}</a>&nbsp;
Yet these have inherited their fathers&rsquo; lying, and they brag of
it.&nbsp; He is a narrow-minded man that affects a triumph in any glorious
study; but to triumph in a lie, and a lie themselves have forged, is
frontless.&nbsp; Folly often goes beyond her bounds; but Impudence knows
none.<br>
<br>
<i>Non nova res livor</i>. - Envy is no new thing, nor was it born only
in our times.&nbsp; The ages past have brought it forth, and the coming
ages will.&nbsp; So long as there are men fit for it, <i>quorum odium
virtute relict&acirc; placet</i>,<i> </i>it will never be wanting.&nbsp;
It is a barbarous envy, to take from those men&rsquo;s virtues which,
because thou canst not arrive at, thou impotently despairest to imitate.&nbsp;
Is it a crime in me that I know that which others had not yet known
but from me? or that I am the author of many things which never would
have come in thy thought but that I taught them?&nbsp; It is new but
a foolish way you have found out, that whom you cannot equal or come
near in doing, you would destroy or ruin with evil speaking; as if you
had bound both your wits and natures &rsquo;prentices to slander, and
then came forth the best artificers when you could form the foulest
calumnies.<br>
<br>
<i>Nil gratius protervo lib</i>. - Indeed nothing is of more credit
or request now than a petulant paper, or scoffing verses; and it is
but convenient to the times and manners we live with, to have then the
worst writings and studies flourish when the best begin to be despised.&nbsp;
Ill arts begin where good end.<br>
<br>
<i>Jam liter&aelig; sordent.</i> - <i>Pastus hodiern. ingen.</i> - The
time was when men would learn and study good things, not envy those
that had them.&nbsp; Then men were had in price for learning; now letters
only make men vile.&nbsp; He is upbraidingly called a poet, as if it
were a contemptible nick-name: but the professors, indeed, have made
the learning cheap - railing and tinkling rhymers, whose writings the
vulgar more greedily read, as being taken with the scurrility and petulancy
of such wits.&nbsp; He shall not have a reader now unless he jeer and
lie.&nbsp; It is the food of men&rsquo;s natures; the diet of the times;
gallants cannot sleep else.&nbsp; The writer must lie and the gentle
reader rests happy to hear the worthiest works misinterpreted, the clearest
actions obscured, the innocentest life traduced: and in such a licence
of lying, a field so fruitful of slanders, how can there be matter wanting
to his laughter?&nbsp; Hence comes the epidemical infection; for how
can they escape the contagion of the writings, whom the virulency of
the calumnies hath not staved off from reading?<br>
<br>
<i>Sed seculi morbus</i>. - Nothing doth more invite a greedy reader
than an unlooked-for subject.&nbsp; And what more unlooked-for than
to see a person of an unblamed life made ridiculous or odious by the
artifice of lying?&nbsp; But it is the disease of the age; and no wonder
if the world, growing old, begin to be infirm: old age itself is a disease.&nbsp;
It is long since the sick world began to dote and talk idly: would she
had but doted still! but her dotage is now broke forth into a madness,
and become a mere frenzy.<br>
<br>
<i>Alastoris malitia</i>. - This Alastor, who hath left nothing unsearched
or unassailed by his impudent and licentious lying in his aguish writings
(for he was in his cold quaking fit all the while), what hath he done
more than a troublesome base cur? barked and made a noise afar off;
had a fool or two to spit in his mouth, and cherish him with a musty
bone?&nbsp; But they are rather enemies of my fame than me, these barkers.<br>
<br>
<i>Mali Choragi fuere</i>. - It is an art to have so much judgment as
to apparel a lie well, to give it a good dressing; that though the nakedness
would show deformed and odious, the suiting of it might draw their readers.&nbsp;
Some love any strumpet, be she never so shop-like or meretricious, in
good clothes.&nbsp; But these, nature could not have formed them better
to destroy their own testimony and overthrow their calumny.<br>
<br>
<i>Hear-say news</i>. - That an elephant, in 1630, came hither ambassador
from the Great Mogul, who could both write and read, and was every day
allowed twelve cast of bread, twenty quarts of Canary sack, besides
nuts and almonds the citizens&rsquo; wives sent him.&nbsp; That he had
a Spanish boy to his interpreter, and his chief negociation was to confer
or practise with Archy, the principal fool of state, about stealing
hence Windsor Castle and carrying it away on his back if he can.<br>
<br>
<i>Lingua sapientis</i>,<i> potius qu&acirc;m loquentis</i>. - A wise
tongue should not be licentious and wandering; but moved and, as it
were, governed with certain reins from the heart and bottom of the breast:
and it was excellently said of that philosopher, that there was a wall
or parapet of teeth set in our mouth, to restrain the petulancy of our
words; that the rashness of talking should not only be retarded by the
guard and watch of our heart, but be fenced in and defended by certain
strengths placed in the mouth itself, and within the lips.&nbsp; But
you shall see some so abound with words, without any seasoning or taste
of matter, in so profound a security, as while they are speaking, for
the most part they confess to speak they know not what.<br>
<br>
Of the two (if either were to be wished) I would rather have a plain
downright wisdom, than a foolish and affected eloquence.&nbsp; For what
is so furious and Bedlam like as a vain sound of chosen and excellent
words, without any subject of sentence or science mixed?<br>
<br>
<i>Optanda.</i> - <i>Thersites Homeri</i>. - Whom the disease of talking
still once possesseth, he can never hold his peace.&nbsp; Nay, rather
than he will not discourse he will hire men to hear him.&nbsp; And so
heard, not hearkened unto, he comes off most times like a mountebank,
that when he hath praised his medicines, finds none will take them,
or trust him.&nbsp; He is like Homer&rsquo;s <i>Thersites.<br>

<i>Homeri Ulysses</i>. - <i>Demacatus Plutarchi</i>. - Ulysses, in Homer,
is made a long-thinking man before he speaks; and Epaminondas is celebrated
by Pindar to be a man that, though he knew much, yet he spoke but little.&nbsp;
Demacatus, when on the bench he was long silent and said nothing, one
asking him if it were folly in him, or want of language, he answered,
&ldquo;A fool could never hold his peace.&rdquo; <a name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c">{31c}</a>&nbsp;
For too much talking is ever the index of a fool.<br>

Nor is that worthy speech of Zeno the philosopher to be passed over
with the note of ignorance; who being invited to a feast in Athens,
where a great prince&rsquo;s ambassadors were entertained, and was the
only person that said nothing at the table; one of them with courtesy
asked him, &ldquo;What shall we return from thee, Zeno, to the prince
our master, if he asks us of thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;more but that you found an old man in Athens that
knew to be silent amongst his cups.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was near a miracle
to see an old man silent, since talking is the disease of age; but amongst
cups makes it fully a wonder.<br>
<br>
<i>Argute dictum</i>. - It was wittily said upon one that was taken
for a great and grave man so long as he held his peace, &ldquo;This

spoken, not the beadle of the ward.&rdquo;&nbsp; &Epsilon;&chi;&epsilon;&mu;&upsilon;&theta;&iota;&alpha;.

<i>Acutius cernuntur vitia quam virtutes.</i> - There is almost no man
but he sees clearlier and sharper the vices in a speaker, than the virtues.&nbsp;
And there are many, that with more ease will find fault with what is
spoken foolishly than can give allowance to that wherein you are wise
silently.&nbsp; The treasure of a fool is always in his tongue, said
the witty comic poet; <a name="citation33c"></a><a href="#footnote33c">{33c}</a>
and it appears not in anything more than in that nation, whereof one,
when he had got the inheritance of an unlucky old grange, would needs
sell it; <a name="citation33d"></a><a href="#footnote33d">{33d}</a>
and to draw buyers proclaimed the virtues of it.&nbsp; Nothing ever
thrived on it, saith he.&nbsp; No owner of it ever died in his bed;
some hung, some drowned themselves; some were banished, some starved;
the trees were all blasted; the swine died of the measles, the cattle
of the murrain, the sheep of the rot; they that stood were ragged, bare,
and bald as your hand; nothing was ever reared there, not a duckling,
or a goose.&nbsp; <i>Hospitium fuerat calamitatis</i>. <a name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a">{34a}</a>&nbsp;
Was not this man like to sell it?<br>
<br>
<i>Vulgi expectatio</i>. - Expectation of the vulgar is more drawn and
held with newness than goodness; we see it in fencers, in players, in
poets, in preachers, in all where fame promiseth anything; so it be
new, though never so naught and depraved, they run to it, and are taken.&nbsp;
Which shews, that the only decay or hurt of the best men&rsquo;s reputation
with the people is, their wits have out-lived the people&rsquo;s palates.&nbsp;
They have been too much or too long a feast.<br>
<br>
<i>Claritas patri&aelig;.</i> - Greatness of name in the father oft-times
helps not forth, but overwhelms the son; they stand too near one another.&nbsp;
The shadow kills the growth: so much, that we see the grandchild come
more and oftener to be heir of the first, than doth the second: he dies
between; the possession is the third&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
<i>Eloquentia.</i> - Eloquence is a great and diverse thing: nor did
she yet ever favour any man so much as to become wholly his.&nbsp; He
is happy that can arrive to any degree of her grace.&nbsp; Yet there
are who prove themselves masters of her, and absolute lords; but I believe
they may mistake their evidence: for it is one thing to be eloquent
in the schools, or in the hall; another at the bar, or in the pulpit.&nbsp;
There is a difference between mooting and pleading; between fencing
and fighting.&nbsp; To make arguments in my study, and confute them,
is easy; where I answer myself, not an adversary.&nbsp; So I can see
whole volumes dispatched by the umbratical doctors on all sides: but
draw these forth into the just lists: let them appear <i>sub dio</i>,<i>
</i>and they are changed with the place, like bodies bred in the shade;
they cannot suffer the sun or a shower, nor bear the open air; they
scarce can find themselves, that they were wont to domineer so among
their auditors: but indeed I would no more choose a rhetorician for
reigning in a school, than I would a pilot for rowing in a pond.<br>
<br>
<i>Amor et odium</i>. - Love that is ignorant, and hatred, have almost
the same ends: many foolish lovers wish the same to their friends, which
their enemies would: as to wish a friend banished, that they might accompany
him in exile; or some great want, that they might relieve him; or a
disease, that they might sit by him.&nbsp; They make a causeway to their
country by injury, as if it were not honester to do nothing than to
seek a way to do good by a mischief.<br>
<br>
<i>Injuria</i>. - Injuries do not extinguish courtesies: they only suffer
them not to appear fair.&nbsp; For a man that doth me an injury after
a courtesy, takes not away that courtesy, but defaces it: as he that
writes other verses upon my verses, takes not away the first letters,
but hides them.<br>
<br>
<i>Beneficia</i>. - Nothing is a courtesy unless it be meant us; and
that friendly and lovingly.&nbsp; We owe no thanks to rivers, that they
carry our boats; or winds, that they be favouring and fill our sails;
or meats, that they be nourishing.&nbsp; For these are what they are
necessarily.&nbsp; Horses carry us, trees shade us, but they know it
not.&nbsp; It is true, some men may receive a courtesy and not know
it; but never any man received it from him that knew it not.&nbsp; Many
men have been cured of diseases by accidents; but they were not remedies.&nbsp;
I myself have known one helped of an ague by falling into a water; another
whipped out of a fever; but no man would ever use these for medicines.&nbsp;
It is the mind, and not the event, that distinguisheth the courtesy
from wrong.&nbsp; My adversary may offend the judge with his pride and
impertinences, and I win my cause; but he meant it not to me as a courtesy.&nbsp;
I scaped pirates by being shipwrecked; was the wreck a benefit therefore?&nbsp;
No; the doing of courtesies aright is the mixing of the respects for
his own sake and for mine.&nbsp; He that doeth them merely for his own
sake is like one that feeds his cattle to sell them; he hath his horse
well dressed for Smithfield.<br>
<br>
<i>Valor rerum.</i> - The price of many things is far above what they
are bought and sold for.&nbsp; Life and health, which are both inestimable,
we have of the physician; as learning and knowledge, the true tillage
of the mind, from our schoolmasters.&nbsp; But the fees of the one or
the salary of the other never answer the value of what we received,
but served to gratify their labours.<br>
<br>
<i>Memoria</i>. - Memory, of all the powers of the mind, is the most
delicate and frail; it is the first of our faculties that age invades.&nbsp;
Seneca, the father, the rhetorician, confesseth of himself he had a
miraculous one, not only to receive but to hold.&nbsp; I myself could,
in my youth, have repeated all that ever I had made, and so continued
till I was past forty; since, it is much decayed in me.&nbsp; Yet I
can repeat whole books that I have read, and poems of some selected
friends which I have liked to charge my memory with.&nbsp; It was wont
to be faithful to me; but shaken with age now, and sloth, which weakens
the strongest abilities, it may perform somewhat, but cannot promise
much.&nbsp; By exercise it is to be made better and serviceable.&nbsp;
Whatsoever I pawned with it while I was young and a boy, it offers me
readily, and without stops; but what I trust to it now, or have done
of later years, it lays up more negligently, and oftentimes loses; so
that I receive mine own (though frequently called for) as if it were
new and borrowed.&nbsp; Nor do I always find presently from it what
I seek; but while I am doing another thing, that I laboured for will
come; and what I sought with trouble will offer itself when I am quiet.&nbsp;
Now, in some men I have found it as happy as Nature, who, whatsoever
they read or pen, they can say without book presently, as if they did
then write in their mind.&nbsp; And it is more a wonder in such as have
a swift style, for their memories are commonly slowest; such as torture
their writings, and go into council for every word, must needs fix somewhat,
and make it their own at last, though but through their own vexation.<br>
<br>
<i>Comit. suffragia.</i> - Suffrages in Parliament are numbered, not
weighed; nor can it be otherwise in those public councils where nothing
is so unequal as the equality; for there, how odd soever men&rsquo;s
brains or wisdoms are, their power is always even and the same.<br>
<br>
<i>Stare &agrave; partibus.</i> - Some actions, be they never so beautiful
and generous, are often obscured by base and vile misconstructions,
either out of envy or ill-nature, that judgeth of others as of itself.&nbsp;
Nay, the times are so wholly grown to be either partial or malicious,
that if he be a friend all sits well about him, his very vices shall
be virtues; if an enemy, or of the contrary faction, nothing is good
or tolerable in him; insomuch that we care not to discredit and shame
our judgments to soothe our passions.<br>
<br>
<i>Deus in creaturis.</i> - Man is read in his face; God in His creatures;
not as the philosopher, the creature of glory, reads him; but as the
divine, the servant of humility; yet even he must take care not to be
too curious.&nbsp; For to utter truth of God but as he thinks only,
may be dangerous, who is best known by our not knowing.&nbsp; Some things
of Him, so much as He hath revealed or commanded, it is not only lawful
but necessary for us to know; for therein our ignorance was the first
cause of our wickedness.<br>
<br>
<i>Veritas proprium hominis.</i> - Truth is man&rsquo;s proper good,
and the only immortal thing was given to our mortality to use.&nbsp;
No good Christian or ethnic, if he be honest, can miss it; no statesman
or patriot should.&nbsp; For without truth all the actions of mankind
are craft, malice, or what you will, rather than wisdom.&nbsp; Homer
says he hates him worse than hell-mouth that utters one thing with his
tongue and keeps another in his breast.&nbsp; Which high expression
was grounded on divine reason; for a lying mouth is a stinking pit,
and murders with the contagion it venteth.&nbsp; Beside, nothing is
lasting that is feigned; it will have another face than it had, ere
long. <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41">{41}</a>&nbsp;
As Euripides saith, &ldquo;No lie ever grows old.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<i>Nullum vitium sine patrocinio.</i> - It is strange there should be
no vice without its patronage, that when we have no other excuse we
will say, we love it, we cannot forsake it.&nbsp; As if that made it
not more a fault.&nbsp; We cannot, because we think we cannot, and we
love it because we will defend it.&nbsp; We will rather excuse it than
be rid of it.&nbsp; That we cannot is pretended; but that we will not
is the true reason.&nbsp; How many have I known that would not have
their vices hid? nay, and, to be noted, live like Antipodes to others
in the same city? never see the sun rise or set in so many years, but
be as they were watching a corpse by torch-light; would not sin the
common way, but held that a kind of rusticity; they would do it new,
or contrary, for the infamy; they were ambitious of living backward;
and at last arrived at that, as they would love nothing but the vices,
not the vicious customs.&nbsp; It was impossible to reform these natures;
they were dried and hardened in their ill.&nbsp; They may say they desired
to leave it, but do not trust them; and they may think they desire it,
but they may lie for all that; they are a little angry with their follies
now and then; marry, they come into grace with them again quickly.&nbsp;
They will confess they are offended with their manner of living like
enough; who is not?&nbsp; When they can put me in security that they
are more than offended, that they hate it, then I will hearken to them,
and perhaps believe them; but many now-a-days love and hate their ill
together.<br>
<br>
<i>De vere argutis</i>. - I do hear them say often some men are not
witty, because they are not everywhere witty; than which nothing is
more foolish.&nbsp; If an eye or a nose be an excellent part in the
face, therefore be all eye or nose!&nbsp; I think the eyebrow, the forehead,
the cheek, chin, lip, or any part else are as necessary and natural
in the place.&nbsp; But now nothing is good that is natural; right and
natural language seems to have least of the wit in it; that which is
writhed and tortured is counted the more exquisite.&nbsp; Cloth of bodkin
or tissue must be embroidered; as if no face were fair that were not
powdered or painted! no beauty to be had but in wresting and writhing
our own tongue!&nbsp; Nothing is fashionable till it be deformed; and
this is to write like a gentleman.&nbsp; All must be affected and preposterous
as our gallants&rsquo; clothes, sweet-bags, and night-dressings, in
which you would think our men lay in, like ladies, it is so curious.<br>
<br>
<i>Censura de poetis</i>. - Nothing in our age, I have observed, is
more preposterous than the running judgments upon poetry and poets;
when we shall hear those things commended and cried up for the best
writings which a man would scarce vouchsafe to wrap any wholesome drug
in; he would never light his tobacco with them.&nbsp; And those men
almost named for miracles, who yet are so vile that if a man should
go about to examine and correct them, he must make all they have done
but one blot.&nbsp; Their good is so entangled with their bad as forcibly
one must draw on the other&rsquo;s death with it.&nbsp; A sponge dipped
in ink will do all:-<br>

<i>Cestius</i> - <i>Cicero</i> - <i>Heath</i> - <i>Taylor</i> - <i>Spenser.</i>
- Yet their vices have not hurt them; nay, a great many they have profited,
for they have been loved for nothing else.&nbsp; And this false opinion
grows strong against the best men, if once it take root with the ignorant.&nbsp;
Cestius, in his time, was preferred to Cicero, so far as the ignorant
durst.&nbsp; They learned him without book, and had him often in their
mouths; but a man cannot imagine that thing so foolish or rude but will
find and enjoy an admirer; at least a reader or spectator.&nbsp; The
puppets are seen now in despite of the players; Heath&rsquo;s epigrams
and the Sculler&rsquo;s poems have their applause.&nbsp; There are never
wanting that dare prefer the worst preachers, the worst pleaders, the
worst poets; not that the better have left to write or speak better,
but that they that hear them judge worse; <i>Non illi pejus dicunt</i>,<i>
sed hi corruptius judicant</i>.&nbsp; Nay, if it were put to the question
of the water-rhymer&rsquo;s works, against Spenser&rsquo;s, I doubt
not but they would find more suffrages; because the most favour common
vices, out of a prerogative the vulgar have to lose their judgments
and like that which is naught.<br>
<br>
Poetry, in this latter age, hath proved but a mean mistress to such
as have wholly addicted themselves to her, or given their names up to
her family.&nbsp; They who have but saluted her on the by, and now and
then tendered their visits, she hath done much for, and advanced in
the way of their own professions (both the law and the gospel) beyond
all they could have hoped or done for themselves without her favour.&nbsp;
Wherein she doth emulate the judicious but preposterous bounty of the
time&rsquo;s grandees, who accumulate all they can upon the parasite
or fresh-man in their friendship; but think an old client or honest
servant bound by his place to write and starve.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the multitude commend writers as they do fencers or wrestlers,
who if they come in robustiously and put for it with a deal of violence
are received for the braver fellows; when many times their own rudeness
is a cause of their disgrace, and a slight touch of their adversary
gives all that boisterous force the foil.&nbsp; But in these things
the unskilful are naturally deceived, and judging wholly by the bulk,
think rude things greater than polished, and scattered more numerous
than composed; nor think this only to be true in the sordid multitude,
but the neater sort of our gallants; for all are the multitude, only
they differ in clothes, not in judgment or understanding.<br>
<br>
<i>De Shakspeare nostrat.</i> - <i>Augustus in Hat</i>. - I remember
the players have often mentioned it as an honour to Shakspeare, that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never blotted out a line.&nbsp;
My answer hath been, &ldquo;Would he had blotted a thousand,&rdquo;
which they thought a malevolent speech.&nbsp; I had not told posterity
this but for their ignorance who chose that circumstance to commend
their friend by wherein he most faulted; and to justify mine own candour,
for I loved the man, and do honour his memory on this side idolatry
as much as any.&nbsp; He was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free
nature, had an excellent phantasy, brave notions, and gentle expressions,
wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary
he should be stopped.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Sufflaminandus erat</i>,&rdquo;
<a name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a">{47a}</a> as Augustus
said of Haterius.&nbsp; His wit was in his own power; would the rule
of it had been so, too.&nbsp; Many times he fell into those things,
could not escape laughter, as when he said in the person of C&aelig;sar,
one speaking to him, &ldquo;C&aelig;sar, thou dost me wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He replied, &ldquo;C&aelig;sar did never wrong but with just cause;&rdquo;
and such like, which were ridiculous.&nbsp; But he redeemed his vices
with his virtues.&nbsp; There was ever more in him to be praised than
to be pardoned.<br>
<br>
<i>Ingeniorum discrimina.</i> - <i>Not. </i>1. - In the difference of
wits I have observed there are many notes; and it is a little maistry
to know them, to discern what every nature, every disposition will bear;
for before we sow our land we should plough it.&nbsp; There are no fewer
forms of minds than of bodies amongst us.&nbsp; The variety is incredible,
and therefore we must search.&nbsp; Some are fit to make divines, some
poets, some lawyers, some physicians; some to be sent to the plough,
and trades.<br>
<br>
There is no doctrine will do good where nature is wanting.&nbsp; Some
wits are swelling and high; others low and still; some hot and fiery;
others cold and dull; one must have a bridle, the other a spur.<br>
<br>
<i>Not. </i>2. - There be some that are forward and bold; and these
will do every little thing easily.&nbsp; I mean that is hard by and
next them, which they will utter unretarded without any shamefastness.&nbsp;
These never perform much, but quickly.&nbsp; They are what they are
on the sudden; they show presently, like grain that, scattered on the
top of the ground, shoots up, but takes no root; has a yellow blade,
but the ear empty.&nbsp; They are wits of good promise at first, but
there is an <i>ingenistitium</i>; <a name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a">{49a}</a>
they stand still at sixteen, they get no higher.<br>
<br>
<i>Not. </i>3. - You have others that labour only to ostentation; and
are ever more busy about the colours and surface of a work than in the
matter and foundation, for that is hid, the other is seen.<br>
<br>
<i>Not. </i>4. - Others that in composition are nothing but what is
rough and broken.&nbsp; <i>Qu&aelig; per salebras</i>,<i> altaque saxa
cadunt. </i><a name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b">{49b}</a>&nbsp;
And if it would come gently, they trouble it of purpose.&nbsp; They
would not have it run without rubs, as if that style were more strong
and manly that struck the ear with a kind of unevenness.&nbsp; These
men err not by chance, but knowingly and willingly; they are like men
that affect a fashion by themselves; have some singularity in a ruff
cloak, or hat-band; or their beards specially cut to provoke beholders,
and set a mark upon themselves.&nbsp; They would be reprehended while
they are looked on.&nbsp; And this vice, one that is authority with
the rest, loving, delivers over to them to be imitated; so that ofttimes
the faults which be fell into the others seek for.&nbsp; This is the
danger, when vice becomes a precedent.<br>
<br>
<i>Not. </i>5. - Others there are that have no composition at all; but
a kind of tuning and rhyming fall in what they write.&nbsp; It runs
and slides, and only makes a sound.&nbsp; Women&rsquo;s poets they are
called, as you have women&rsquo;s tailors.<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They write a verse as smooth, as soft as cream,<br>
In which there is no torrent, nor scarce stream.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
You may sound these wits and find the depth of them with your middle
finger.&nbsp; They are cream-bowl or but puddle-deep.<br>
<br>
<i>Not. </i>6. - Some that turn over all books, and are equally searching
in all papers; that write out of what they presently find or meet, without
choice.&nbsp; By which means it happens that what they have discredited
and impugned in one week, they have before or after extolled the same
in another.&nbsp; Such are all the essayists, even their master Montaigne.&nbsp;
These, in all they write, confess still what books they have read last,
and therein their own folly so much, that they bring it to the stake
raw and undigested; not that the place did need it neither, but that
they thought themselves furnished and would vent it<br>
<br>
<i>Not. </i>7. - Some, again who, after they have got authority, or,
which is less, opinion, by their writings, to have read much, dare presently
to feign whole books and authors, and lie safely.&nbsp; For what never
was, will not easily be found, not by the most curious.<br>
<br>
<i>Not. </i>8. - And some, by a cunning protestation against all reading,
and false venditation of their own naturals, think to divert the sagacity
of their readers from themselves, and cool the scent of their own fox-like
thefts; when yet they are so rank, as a man may find whole pages together
usurped from one author; their necessities compelling them to read for
present use, which could not be in many books; and so come forth more
ridiculously and palpably guilty than those who, because they cannot
trace, they yet would slander their industry.<br>
<br>
<i>Not. </i>9. - But the wretcheder are the obstinate contemners of
all helps and arts; such as presuming on their own naturals (which,
perhaps, are excellent), dare deride all diligence, and seem to mock
at the terms when they understand not the things; thinking that way
to get off wittily with their ignorance.&nbsp; These are imitated often
by such as are their peers in negligence, though they cannot be in nature;
and they utter all they can think with a kind of violence and indisposition,
unexamined, without relation either to person, place, or any fitness
else; and the more wilful and stubborn they are in it the more learned
they are esteemed of the multitude, through their excellent vice of
judgment, who think those things the stronger that have no art; as if
to break were better than to open, or to rend asunder gentler than to
loose.<br>
<br>
<i>Not. </i>10. - It cannot but come to pass that these men who commonly
seek to do more than enough may sometimes happen on something that is
good and great; but very seldom: and when it comes it doth not recompense
the rest of their ill.&nbsp; For their jests, and their sentences (which
they only and ambitiously seek for) stick out, and are more eminent,
because all is sordid and vile about them; as lights are more discerned
in a thick darkness than a faint shadow.&nbsp; Now, because they speak
all they can (however unfitly), they are thought to have the greater
copy; where the learned use ever election and a mean, they look back
to what they intended at first, and make all an even and proportioned
body.&nbsp; The true artificer will not run away from Nature as he were
afraid of her, or depart from life and the likeness of truth, but speak
to the capacity of his hearers.&nbsp; And though his language differ
from the vulgar somewhat, it shall not fly from all humanity, with the
Tamerlanes and Tamer-chains of the late age, which had nothing in them
but the scenical strutting and furious vociferation to warrant them
to the ignorant gapers.&nbsp; He knows it is his only art so to carry
it, as none but artificers perceive it.&nbsp; In the meantime, perhaps,
he is called barren, dull, lean, a poor writer, or by what contumelious
word can come in their cheeks, by these men who, without labour, judgment,
knowledge, or almost sense, are received or preferred before him.&nbsp;
He gratulates them and their fortune.&nbsp; Another age, or juster men,
will acknowledge the virtues of his studies, his wisdom in dividing,
his subtlety in arguing, with what strength he doth inspire his readers,
with what sweetness he strokes them; in inveighing, what sharpness;
in jest, what urbanity he uses; how he doth reign in men&rsquo;s affections;
how invade and break in upon them, and makes their minds like the thing
he writes.&nbsp; Then in his elocution to behold what word is proper,
which hath ornaments, which height, what is beautifully translated,
where figures are fit, which gentle, which strong, to show the composition
manly; and how he hath avoided faint, obscure, obscene, sordid, humble,
improper, or effeminate phrase; which is not only praised of the most,
but commended (which is worse), especially for that it is naught.<br>
<br>
<i>Ignorantia anim&aelig;</i>. - I know no disease of the soul but ignorance,
not of the arts and sciences, but of itself; yet relating to those it
is a pernicious evil, the darkener of man&rsquo;s life, the disturber
of his reason, and common confounder of truth, with which a man goes
groping in the dark, no otherwise than if he were blind.&nbsp; Great
understandings are most racked and troubled with it; nay, sometimes
they will rather choose to die than not to know the things they study
for.&nbsp; Think, then, what an evil it is, and what good the contrary.<br>
<br>
<i>Scientia</i>. - Knowledge is the action of the soul and is perfect
without the senses, as having the seeds of all science and virtue in
itself; but not without the service of the senses; by these organs the
soul works: she is a perpetual agent, prompt and subtle; but often flexible
and erring, entangling herself like a silkworm, but her reason is a
weapon with two edges, and cuts through.&nbsp; In her indagations oft-times
new scents put her by, and she takes in errors into her by the same
conduits she doth truths.<br>
<br>
<i>Otium Studiorum.</i> - Ease and relaxation are profitable to all
studies.&nbsp; The mind is like a bow, the stronger by being unbent.&nbsp;
But the temper in spirits is all, when to command a man&rsquo;s wit,
when to favour it.&nbsp; I have known a man vehement on both sides,
that knew no mean, either to intermit his studies or call upon them
again.&nbsp; When he hath set himself to writing he would join night
to day, press upon himself without release, not minding it, till he
fainted; and when he left off, resolve himself into all sports and looseness
again, that it was almost a despair to draw him to his book; but once
got to it, he grew stronger and more earnest by the ease.&nbsp; His
whole powers were renewed; he would work out of himself what he desired,
but with such excess as his study could not be ruled; he knew not how
to dispose his own abilities, or husband them; he was of that immoderate
power against himself.&nbsp; Nor was he only a strong, but an absolute
speaker and writer; but his subtlety did not show itself; his judgment
thought that a vice; for the ambush hurts more that is hid.&nbsp; He
never forced his language, nor went out of the highway of speaking but
for some great necessity or apparent profit; for he denied figures to
be invented for ornament, but for aid; and still thought it an extreme
madness to bind or wrest that which ought to be right.<br>
<br>
<i>Stili eminentia.</i> - <i>Virgil.</i> - <i>Tully.</i> - <i>Sallust.</i>
- It is no wonder men&rsquo;s eminence appears but in their own way.&nbsp;
Virgil&rsquo;s felicity left him in prose, as Tully&rsquo;s forsook
him in verse.&nbsp; Sallust&rsquo;s orations are read in the honour
of story, yet the most eloquent.&nbsp; Plato&rsquo;s speech, which he
made for Socrates, is neither worthy of the patron nor the person defended.&nbsp;
Nay, in the same kind of oratory, and where the matter is one, you shall
have him that reasons strongly, open negligently; another that prepares
well, not fit so well.&nbsp; And this happens not only to brains, but
to bodies.&nbsp; One can wrestle well, another run well, a third leap
or throw the bar, a fourth lift or stop a cart going; each hath his
way of strength.&nbsp; So in other creatures - some dogs are for the
deer, some for the wild boar, some are fox-hounds, some otter-hounds.&nbsp;
Nor are all horses for the coach or saddle, some are for the cart and
paniers.<br>
<br>
<i>De Claris Oratoribus.</i> - I have known many excellent men that
would speak suddenly to the admiration of their hearers, who upon study
and premeditation have been forsaken by their own wits, and no way answered
their fame; their eloquence was greater than their reading, and the
things they uttered better than those they knew; their fortune deserved
better of them than their care.&nbsp; For men of present spirits, and
of greater wits than study, do please more in the things they invent
than in those they bring.&nbsp; And I have heard some of them compelled
to speak, out of necessity, that have so infinitely exceeded themselves,
as it was better both for them and their auditory that they were so
surprised, not prepared.&nbsp; Nor was it safe then to cross them, for
their adversary, their anger made them more eloquent.&nbsp; Yet these
men I could not but love and admire, that they returned to their studies.&nbsp;
They left not diligence (as many do) when their rashness prospered;
for diligence is a great aid, even to an indifferent wit; when we are
not contented with the examples of our own age, but would know the face
of the former.&nbsp; Indeed, the more we confer with the more we profit
by, if the persons be chosen.<br>
<br>
<i>Dominus Verulamius</i>. - One, though he be excellent and the chief,
is not to be imitated alone; for no imitator ever grew up to his author;
likeness is always on this side truth.&nbsp; Yet there happened in my
time one noble speaker who was full of gravity in his speaking; his
language (where he could spare or pass by a jest) was nobly censorious.&nbsp;
No man ever spake more neatly, more pressly, more weightily, or suffered
less emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered.&nbsp; No member of
his speech but consisted of his own graces.&nbsp; His hearers could
not cough, or look aside from him, without loss.&nbsp; He commanded
where he spoke, and had his judges angry and pleased at his devotion.&nbsp;
No man had their affections more in his power.&nbsp; The fear of every
man that heard him was lest he should make an end.<br>
<br>
<i>Scriptorum catalogus</i>. <a name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a">{59a}</a>&nbsp;
Cicero is said to be the only wit that the people of Rome had equalled
to their empire.&nbsp; <i>Ingenium par imperio</i>.&nbsp; We have had
many, and in their several ages (to take in but the former <i>seculum</i>)
Sir Thomas More, the elder Wiat, Henry Earl of Surrey, Chaloner, Smith,
Eliot, B. Gardiner, were for their times admirable; and the more, because
they began eloquence with us.&nbsp; Sir Nicolas Bacon was singular,
and almost alone, in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;
Sir Philip Sidney and Mr. Hooker (in different matter) grew great masters
of wit and language, and in whom all vigour of invention and strength
of judgment met.&nbsp; The Earl of Essex, noble and high; and Sir Walter
Raleigh, not to be contemned, either for judgment or style.&nbsp; Sir
Henry Savile, grave, and truly lettered; Sir Edwin Sandys, excellent
in both; Lord Egerton, the Chancellor, a grave and great orator, and
best when he was provoked; but his learned and able (though unfortunate)
successor is he who hath filled up all numbers, and performed that in
our tongue which may be compared or preferred either to insolent Greece
or haughty Rome.&nbsp; In short, within his view, and about his times,
were all the wits born that could honour a language or help study.&nbsp;
Now things daily fall, wits grow downward, and eloquence grows backward;
so that he may be named and stand as the mark and &alpha;&kappa;&mu;&eta;<i>
</i>of our language.<br>
<br>
<i>De augmentis scientiarum.</i> - <i>Julius C&aelig;sar.</i> - <i>Lord
St. Alban</i>. - I have ever observed it to have been the office of
a wise patriot, among the greatest affairs of the State, to take care
of the commonwealth of learning.&nbsp; For schools, they are the seminaries
of State; and nothing is worthier the study of a statesman than that
part of the republic which we call the advancement of letters.&nbsp;
Witness the care of Julius C&aelig;sar, who, in the heat of the civil
war, writ his books of Analogy, and dedicated them to Tully.&nbsp; This
made the late Lord St. Alban entitle his work <i>Novum Organum; </i>which,
though by the most of superficial men, who cannot get beyond the title
of nominals, it is not penetrated nor understood, it really openeth
all defects of learning whatsoever, and is a book<br>
<br>

<br>
My conceit of his person was never increased toward him by his place
or honours; but I have and do reverence him for the greatness that was
only proper to himself, in that he seemed to me ever, by his work, one
of the greatest men, and most worthy of admiration, that had been in
many ages.&nbsp; In his adversity I ever prayed that God would give
him strength; for greatness he could not want.&nbsp; Neither could I
condole in a word or syllable for him, as knowing no accident could
do harm to virtue, but rather help to make it manifest.<br>
<br>
<i>De corruptela morum</i>. - There cannot be one colour of the mind,
another of the wit.&nbsp; If the mind be staid, grave, and composed,
the wit is so; that vitiated, the other is blown and deflowered.&nbsp;
Do we not see, if the mind languish, the members are dull?&nbsp; Look
upon an effeminate person, his very gait confesseth him.&nbsp; If a
man be fiery, his motion is so; if angry, it is troubled and violent.&nbsp;
So that we may conclude wheresoever manners and fashions are corrupted,
language is.&nbsp; It imitates the public riot.&nbsp; The excess of
feasts and apparel are the notes of a sick state, and the wantonness
of language of a sick mind.<br>
<br>
<i>De rebus mundanis</i>. - If we would consider what our affairs are
indeed, not what they are called, we should find more evils belonging
to us than happen to us.&nbsp; How often doth that which was called
a calamity prove the beginning and cause of a man&rsquo;s happiness?
and, on the contrary, that which happened or came to another with great
gratulation and applause, how it hath lifted him but a step higher to
his ruin? as if he stood before where he might fall safely.<br>
<br>
<i>Vulgi mores.</i> - <i>Morbus comitialis.</i> - The vulgar are commonly
ill-natured, and always grudging against their governors: which makes
that a prince has more business and trouble with them than ever Hercules
had with the bull or any other beast; by how much they have more heads
than will be reined with one bridle.&nbsp; There was not that variety
of beasts in the ark, as is of beastly natures in the multitude; especially
when they come to that iniquity to censure their sovereign&rsquo;s actions.&nbsp;
Then all the counsels are made good or bad by the events; and it falleth
out that the same facts receive from them the names, now of diligence,
now of vanity, now of majesty, now of fury; where they ought wholly
to hang on his mouth, as he to consist of himself, and not others&rsquo;
counsels.<br>
<br>
<i>Princeps.</i> - After God, nothing is to be loved of man like the
prince; he violates Nature that doth it not with his whole heart.&nbsp;
For when he hath put on the care of the public good and common safety,
I am a wretch, and put off man, if I do not reverence and honour him,
in whose charge all things divine and human are placed.&nbsp; Do but
ask of Nature why all living creatures are less delighted with meat
and drink that sustains them than with venery that wastes them? and
she will tell thee, the first respects but a private, the other a common
good, propagation.<br>
<br>
<i>De eodem.</i> - <i>Orpheus&rsquo; Hymn.</i> - He is the arbiter of
life and death: when he finds no other subject for his mercy, he should
spare himself.&nbsp; All his punishments are rather to correct than
to destroy.&nbsp; Why are prayers with Orpheus said to be the daughters
of Jupiter, but that princes are thereby admonished that the petitions
of the wretched ought to have more weight with them than the laws themselves.<br>
<br>
<i>De opt. Rege Jacobo</i>. - It was a great accumulation to His Majesty&rsquo;s
deserved praise that men might openly visit and pity those whom his
greatest prisons had at any time received or his laws condemned.<br>
<br>
<i>De Princ. adjunctis.</i> - <i>Sed ver&egrave; prudens haud concipi
possit Princeps</i>,<i> nisi simul et bonus.</i> - <i>Lycurgus.</i>
- <i>Sylla.</i> - <i>Lysander.</i> - <i>Cyrus.</i> - Wise is rather
the attribute of a prince than learned or good.&nbsp; The learned man
profits others rather than himself; the good man rather himself than
others; but the prince commands others, and doth himself.<br>
<br>
The wise Lycurgus gave no law but what himself kept.&nbsp; Sylla and
Lysander did not so; the one living extremely dissolute himself, enforced
frugality by the laws; the other permitted those licenses to others
which himself abstained from.&nbsp; But the prince&rsquo;s prudence
is his chief art and safety.&nbsp; In his counsels and deliberations
he foresees the future times: in the equity of his judgment he hath
remembrance of the past, and knowledge of what is to be done or avoided
for the present.&nbsp; Hence the Persians gave out their Cyrus to have
been nursed by a bitch, a creature to encounter it, as of sagacity to
seek out good; showing that wisdom may accompany fortitude, or it leaves
to be, and puts on the name of rashness.<br>
<br>
<i>De malign. studentium</i>. - There be some men are born only to suck
out the poison of books: <i>Habent venenum pro victu</i>;<i> im&ocirc;</i>,<i>
pro deliciis</i>. <a name="citation66a"></a><a href="#footnote66a">{66a}</a>&nbsp;
And such are they that only relish the obscene and foul things in poets,
which makes the profession taxed.&nbsp; But by whom?&nbsp; Men that
watch for it; and, had they not had this hint, are so unjust valuers
of letters as they think no learning good but what brings in gain.&nbsp;
It shows they themselves would never have been of the professions they
are but for the profits and fees.&nbsp; But if another learning, well
used, can instruct to good life, inform manners, no less persuade and
lead men than they threaten and compel, and have no reward, is it therefore
the worst study?&nbsp; I could never think the study of wisdom confined
only to the philosopher, or of piety to the divine, or of state to the
politic; but that he which can feign a commonwealth (which is the poet)
can govern it with counsels, strengthen it with laws, correct it with
judgments, inform it with religion and morals, is all these.&nbsp; We
do not require in him mere elocution, or an excellent faculty in verse,
but the exact knowledge of all virtues and their contraries, with ability
to render the one loved, the other hated, by his proper embattling them.&nbsp;
The philosophers did insolently, to challenge only to themselves that
which the greatest generals and gravest counsellors never durst.&nbsp;
For such had rather do than promise the best things.<br>
<br>
<i>Controvers. scriptores.</i> - <i>More Andabatarum qui clausis oculis
pugnant.</i> <i>- </i>Some controverters in divinity are like swaggerers
in a tavern that catch that which stands next them, the candlestick
or pots; turn everything into a weapon: ofttimes they fight blindfold,
and both beat the air.&nbsp; The one milks a he-goat, the other holds
under a sieve.&nbsp; Their arguments are as fluxive as liquor spilt
upon a table, which with your finger you may drain as you will.&nbsp;
Such controversies or disputations (carried with more labour than profit)
are odious; where most times the truth is lost in the midst or left
untouched.&nbsp; And the fruit of their fight is, that they spit one
upon another, and are both defiled.&nbsp; These fencers in religion
I like not.<br>
<br>
<i>Morbi.</i> - The body hath certain diseases that are with less evil
tolerated than removed.&nbsp; As if to cure a leprosy a man should bathe
himself with the warm blood of a murdered child, so in the Church some
errors may be dissimuled with less inconvenience than they can be discovered.<br>
<br>
<i>Jactantia intempestiva.</i> - Men that talk of their own benefits
are not believed to talk of them because they have done them; but to
have done them because they might talk of them.&nbsp; That which had
been great, if another had reported it of them, vanisheth, and is nothing,
if he that did it speak of it.&nbsp; For men, when they cannot destroy
the deed, will yet be glad to take advantage of the boasting, and lessen
it.<br>
<br>
<i>Adulatio.</i> - I have seen that poverty makes me do unfit things;
but honest men should not do them; they should gain otherwise.&nbsp;
Though a man be hungry, he should not play the parasite.&nbsp; That
hour wherein I would repent me to be honest, there were ways enough
open for me to be rich.&nbsp; But flattery is a fine pick-lock of tender
ears; especially of those whom fortune hath borne high upon their wings,
that submit their dignity and authority to it, by a soothing of themselves.&nbsp;
For, indeed, men could never be taken in that abundance with the springes
of others&rsquo; flattery, if they began not there; if they did but
remember how much more profitable the bitterness of truth were, than
all the honey distilling from a whorish voice, which is not praise,
but poison.&nbsp; But now it is come to that extreme folly, or rather
madness, with some, that he that flatters them modestly or sparingly
is thought to malign them.&nbsp; If their friend consent not to their
vices, though he do not contradict them, he is nevertheless an enemy.&nbsp;
When they do all things the worst way, even then they look for praise.&nbsp;
Nay, they will hire fellows to flatter them with suits and suppers,
and to prostitute their judgments.&nbsp; They have livery-friends, friends
of the dish, and of the spit, that wait their turns, as my lord has
his feasts and guests.<br>
<br>
<i>De vit&acirc; human&acirc;</i>. - I have considered our whole life
is like a play: wherein every man forgetful of himself, is in travail
with expression of another.&nbsp; Nay, we so insist in imitating others,
as we cannot when it is necessary return to ourselves; like children,
that imitate the vices of stammerers so long, till at last they become
such; and make the habit to another nature, as it is never forgotten.<br>
<br>
<i>De piis et probis.</i> - Good<i> </i>men are the stars, the planets
of the ages wherein they live and illustrate the times.&nbsp; God did
never let them be wanting to the world: as Abel, for an example of innocency,
Enoch of purity, Noah of trust in God&rsquo;s mercies, Abraham of faith,
and so of the rest.&nbsp; These, sensual men thought mad because they
would not be partakers or practisers of their madness.&nbsp; But they,
placed high on the top of all virtue, looked down on the stage of the
world and contemned the play of fortune.&nbsp; For though the most be
players, some must be spectators.<br>
<br>
<i>Mores aulici</i>. - I have discovered that a feigned familiarity
in great ones is a note of certain usurpation on the less.&nbsp; For
great and popular men feign themselves to be servants to others to make
those slaves to them.&nbsp; So the fisher provides bait for the trout,
roach, dace, &amp;c., that they may be food to him.<br>
<br>
<i>Impiorum querela.</i> - <i>Augusties.</i> - <i>Varus.</i> - <i>Tiberius</i>.
- The complaint of Caligula was most wicked of the condition of his
times, when he said they were not famous for any public calamity, as
the reign of Augustus was, by the defeat of Varus and the legions; and
that of Tiberius, by the falling of the theatre at Fiden&aelig;; whilst
his oblivion was eminent through the prosperity of his affairs.&nbsp;
As that other voice of his was worthier a headsman than a head when
he wished the people of Rome had but one neck.&nbsp; But he found when
he fell they had many hands.&nbsp; A tyrant, how great and mighty soever
he may seem to cowards and sluggards, is but one creature, one animal.<br>
<br>
<i>Nobilium ingenia</i>. - I have marked among the nobility some are
so addicted to the service of the prince and commonwealth, as they look
not for spoil; such are to be honoured and loved.&nbsp; There are others
which no obligation will fasten on; and they are of two sorts.&nbsp;
The first are such as love their own ease; or, out of vice, of nature,
or self-direction, avoid business and care.&nbsp; Yet these the prince
may use with safety.&nbsp; The other remove themselves upon craft and
design, as the architects say, with a premeditated thought, to their
own rather than their prince&rsquo;s profit.&nbsp; Such let the prince
take heed of, and not doubt to reckon in the list of his open enemies.<br>
<br>
<i>Principum. varia.</i> - <i>Firmissima ver&ograve; omnium basis jus
h&aelig;reditarium Principis.</i> - There is a great variation between
him that is raised to the sovereignty by the favour of his peers and
him that comes to it by the suffrage of the people.&nbsp; The first
holds with more difficulty, because he hath to do with many that think
themselves his equals, and raised him for their own greatness and oppression
of the rest.&nbsp; The latter hath no upbraiders, but was raised by
them that sought to be defended from oppression: whose end is both easier
and the honester to satisfy.&nbsp; Beside, while he hath the people
to friend, who are a multitude, he hath the less fear of the nobility,
who are but few.&nbsp; Nor let the common proverb (of he that builds
on the people builds on the dirt) discredit my opinion: for that hath
only place where an ambitious and private person, for some popular end,
trusts in them against the public justice and magistrate.&nbsp; There
they will leave him.&nbsp; But when a prince governs them, so as they
have still need of his administrations (for that is his art), he shall
ever make and hold them faithful.<br>
<br>
<i>Clementia.</i> - <i>Machiavell</i>. - A prince should exercise his
cruelty not by himself but by his ministers; so he may save himself
and his dignity with his people by sacrificing those when he list, saith
the great doctor of state, Machiavell.&nbsp; But I say he puts off man
and goes into a beast, that is cruel.&nbsp; No virtue is a prince&rsquo;s
own, or becomes him more, than this clemency: and no glory is greater
than to be able to save with his power.&nbsp; Many punishments sometimes,
and in some cases, as much discredit a prince, as many funerals a physician.&nbsp;
The state of things is secured by clemency; severity represseth a few,
but irritates more. <a name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a">{74a}</a>&nbsp;
The lopping of trees makes the boughs shoot out thicker; and the taking
away of some kind of enemies increaseth the number.&nbsp; It is then
most gracious in a prince to pardon when many about him would make him
cruel; to think then how much he can save when others tell him how much
he can destroy; not to consider what the impotence of others hath demolished,
but what his own greatness can sustain.&nbsp; These are a prince&rsquo;s
virtues: and they that give him other counsels are but the hangman&rsquo;s
factors.<br>
<br>
<i>Clementia tutela optima.</i> - He<i> </i>that is cruel to halves
(saith the said St. Nicholas <a name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b">{74b}</a>)
loseth no less the opportunity of his cruelty than of his benefits:
for then to use his cruelty is too late; and to use his favours will
be interpreted fear and necessity, and so he loseth the thanks.&nbsp;
Still the counsel is cruelty.&nbsp; But princes, by hearkening to cruel
counsels, become in time obnoxious to the authors, their flatterers,
and ministers; and are brought to that, that when they would, they dare
not change them; they must go on and defend cruelty with cruelty; they
cannot alter the habit.&nbsp; It is then grown necessary, they must
be as ill as those have made them: and in the end they will grow more
hateful to themselves than to their subjects.&nbsp; Whereas, on the
contrary, the merciful prince is safe in love, not in fear.&nbsp; He
needs no emissaries, spies, intelligencers to entrap true subjects.&nbsp;
He fears no libels, no treasons.&nbsp; His people speak what they think,
and talk openly what they do in secret.&nbsp; They have nothing in their
breasts that they need a cypher for.&nbsp; He is guarded with his own
benefits.<br>
<br>
<i>Religio.&nbsp; Palladium Homeri.</i> - <i>Euripides.</i> - The strength
of empire is in religion.&nbsp; What else is the Palladium (with Homer)
that kept Troy so long from sacking?&nbsp; Nothing more commends the
Sovereign to the subject than it.&nbsp; For he that is religious must
be merciful and just necessarily: and they are two strong ties upon
mankind.&nbsp; Justice the virtue that innocence rejoiceth in.&nbsp;
Yet even that is not always so safe, but it may love to stand in the
sight of mercy.&nbsp; For sometimes misfortune is made a crime, and
then innocence is succoured no less than virtue.&nbsp; Nay, oftentimes
virtue is made capital; and through the condition of the times it may
happen that that may be punished with our praise.&nbsp; Let no man therefore
murmur at the actions of the prince, who is placed so far above him.&nbsp;
If he offend, he hath his discoverer.&nbsp; God hath a height beyond
him.&nbsp; But where the prince is good, Euripides saith, &ldquo;God
is a guest in a human body.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<i>Tyranni.</i> - <i>Sejanus.</i> - There is nothing with some princes
sacred above their majesty, or profane, but what violates their sceptres.&nbsp;
But a prince, with such a council, is like the god Terminus, of stone,
his own landmark, or (as it is in the fable) a crowned lion.&nbsp; It
is dangerous offending such a one, who, being angry, knows not how to
forgive; that cares not to do anything for maintaining or enlarging
of empire; kills not men or subjects, but destroyeth whole countries,
armies, mankind, male and female, guilty or not guilty, holy or profane;
yea, some that have not seen the light.&nbsp; All is under the law of
their spoil and licence.&nbsp; But princes that neglect their proper
office thus their fortune is oftentimes to draw a Sejanus to be near
about them, who at last affect to get above them, and put them in a
worthy fear of rooting both them out and their family.&nbsp; For no
men hate an evil prince more than they that helped to make him such.&nbsp;
And none more boastingly weep his ruin than they that procured and practised
it.&nbsp; The same path leads to ruin which did to rule when men profess
a licence in government.&nbsp; A good king is a public servant.<br>
<br>
<i>Illiteratus princeps.</i> - A prince without letters is a pilot without
eyes.&nbsp; All his government is groping.&nbsp; In sovereignty it is
a most happy thing not to be compelled; but so it is the most miserable
not to be counselled.&nbsp; And how can he be counselled that cannot
see to read the best counsellors (which are books), for they neither
flatter us nor hide from us?&nbsp; He may hear, you will say; but how
shall he always be sure to hear truth, or be counselled the best things,
not the sweetest?&nbsp; They say princes learn no art truly but the
art of horsemanship.&nbsp; The reason is the brave beast is no flatterer.&nbsp;
He will throw a prince as soon as his groom.&nbsp; Which is an argument
that the good counsellors to princes are the best instruments of a good
age.&nbsp; For though the prince himself be of a most prompt inclination
to all virtue, yet the best pilots have needs of mariners besides sails,
anchor, and other tackle.<br>
<br>
<i>Character principis.</i> - <i>Alexander magnus.</i> - If men did
know what shining fetters, gilded miseries, and painted happiness thrones
and sceptres were there would not be so frequent strife about the getting
or holding of them; there would be more principalities than princes;
for a prince is the pastor of the people.&nbsp; He ought to shear, not
to flay his sheep; to take their fleeces, not their the soul of the
commonwealth, and ought to cherish it as his own body.&nbsp; Alexander
the Great was wont to say, &ldquo;He hated that gardener that plucked
his herbs or flowers up by the roots.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man may milk a
beast till the blood come; churn milk and it yieldeth butter, but wring
the nose and the blood followeth.&nbsp; He is an ill prince that so
pulls his subjects&rsquo; feathers as he would not have them grow again;
that makes his exchequer a receipt for the spoils of those he governs.&nbsp;
No, let him keep his own, not affect his subjects&rsquo;; strive rather
to be called just than powerful.&nbsp; Not, like the Roman tyrants,
affect the surnames that grow by human slaughters; neither to seek war
in peace, nor peace in war, but to observe faith given, though to an
enemy.&nbsp; Study piety toward the subject; show care to defend him.&nbsp;
Be slow to punish in divers cases, but be a sharp and severe revenger
of open crimes.&nbsp; Break no decrees or dissolve no orders to slacken
the strength of laws.&nbsp; Choose neither magistrates, civil or ecclesiastical,
by favour or price; but with long disquisition and report of their worth
by all suffrages.&nbsp; Sell no honours, nor give them hastily, but
bestow them with counsel and for reward; if he do, acknowledge it (though
late), and mend it.&nbsp; For princes are easy to be deceived; and what
wisdom can escape where so many court-arts are studied?&nbsp; But, above
all, the prince is to remember that when the great day of account comes,
which neither magistrate nor prince can shun, there will be required
of him a reckoning for those whom he hath trusted, as for himself, which
he must provide.&nbsp; And if piety be wanting in the priests, equity
in the judges, or the magistrates be found rated at a price, what justice
or religion is to be expected? which are the only two attributes make
kings akin to God, and is the Delphic sword, both to kill sacrifices
and to chastise offenders.<br>
<br>
<i>De gratiosis</i>. - When a virtuous man is raised, it brings gladness
to his friends, grief to his enemies, and glory to his posterity.&nbsp;
Nay, his honours are a great part of the honour of the times; when by
this means he is grown to active men an example, to the slothful a spur,
to the envious a punishment.<br>
<br>
<i>Divites. - Heredes ex asse</i>.&nbsp; He which is sole heir to many
rich men, having (besides his father&rsquo;s and uncle&rsquo;s) the
estates of divers his kindred come to him by accession, must needs be
richer than father or grandfather; so they which are left heirs <i>ex
asse </i>of all their ancestors&rsquo; vices, and by their good husbandry
improve the old and daily purchase new, must needs be wealthier in vice,
and have a greater revenue or stock of ill to spend on.<br>
<br>
<i>Fures publici.</i> - The great thieves of a state are lightly the
officers of the crown; they hang the less still, play the pikes in the
pond, eat whom they list.&nbsp; The net was never spread for the hawk
or buzzard that hurt us, but the harmless birds; they are good meat:-<br>

<i>Lewis XI.</i> - But<i> </i>they are not always safe though, especially
when they meet with wise masters.&nbsp; They can take down all the huff
and swelling of their looks, and like dexterous auditors place the counter
where he shall value nothing.&nbsp; Let them but remember Lewis XI.,
who to a Clerk of the Exchequer that came to be Lord Treasurer, and
had (for his device) represented himself sitting on fortune&rsquo;s
wheel, told him he might do well to fasten it with a good strong nail,
lest, turning about, it might bring him where he was again.&nbsp; As
indeed it did.<br>
<br>
<i>De bonis et malis.</i> - <i>De innocenti&acirc;</i>. - A good man
will avoid the spot of any sin.&nbsp; The very aspersion is grievous,
which makes him choose his way in his life as he would in his journey.&nbsp;
The ill man rides through all confidently; he is coated and booted for
it.&nbsp; The oftener he offends, the more openly, and the fouler, the
fitter in fashion.&nbsp; His modesty, like a riding-coat, the more it
is worn is the less cared for.&nbsp; It is good enough for the dirt
still, and the ways he travels in.&nbsp; An innocent man needs no eloquence,
his innocence is instead of it, else I had never come off so many times
from these precipices, whither men&rsquo;s malice hath pursued me.&nbsp;
It is true I have been accused to the lords, to the king, and by great
ones, but it happened my accusers had not thought of the accusation
with themselves, and so were driven, for want of crimes, to use invention,
which was found slander, or too late (being entered so fair) to seek
starting-holes for their rashness, which were not given them.&nbsp;
And then they may think what accusation that was like to prove, when
they that were the engineers feared to be the authors.&nbsp; Nor were
they content to feign things against me, but to urge things, feigned
by the ignorant, against my profession, which though, from their hired
and mercenary impudence, I might have passed by as granted to a nation
of barkers that let out their tongues to lick others&rsquo; sores; yet
I durst not leave myself undefended, having a pair of ears unskilful
to hear lies, or have those things said of me which I could truly prove
of them.&nbsp; They objected making of verses to me, when I could object
to most of them, their not being able to read them, but as worthy of
scorn.&nbsp; Nay, they would offer to urge mine own writings against
me, but by pieces (which was an excellent way of malice), as if any
man&rsquo;s context might not seem dangerous and offensive, if that
which was knit to what went before were defrauded of his beginning;
or that things by themselves uttered might not seem subject to calumny,
which read entire would appear most free.&nbsp; At last they upbraided
my poverty: I confess she is my domestic; sober of diet, simple of habit,
frugal, painful, a good counseller to me, that keeps me from cruelty,
pride, or other more delicate impertinences, which are the nurse-children
of riches.&nbsp; But let them look over all the great and monstrous
wickednesses, they shall never find those in poor families.&nbsp; They
are the issue of the wealthy giants and the mighty hunters, whereas
no great work, or worthy of praise or memory, but came out of poor cradles.&nbsp;
It was the ancient poverty that founded commonweals, built cities, invented
arts, made wholesome laws, armed men against vices, rewarded them with
their own virtues, and preserved the honour and state of nations, till
they betrayed themselves to riches.<br>
<br>
<i>Amor nummi</i>. - Money never made any man rich, but his mind.&nbsp;
He that can order himself to the law of Nature is not only without the
sense but the fear of poverty.&nbsp; O! but to strike blind the people
with our wealth and pomp is the thing!&nbsp; What a wretchedness is
this, to thrust all our riches outward, and be beggars within; to contemplate
nothing but the little, vile, and sordid things of the world; not the
great, noble, and precious!&nbsp; We serve our avarice, and, not content
with the good of the earth that is offered us, we search and dig for
the evil that is hidden.&nbsp; God offered us those things, and placed
them at hand, and near us, that He knew were profitable for us, but
the hurtful He laid deep and hid.&nbsp; Yet do we seek only the things
whereby we may perish, and bring them forth, when God and Nature hath
buried them.&nbsp; We covet superfluous things, when it were more honour
for us if we would contemn necessary.&nbsp; What need hath Nature of
silver dishes, multitudes of waiters, delicate pages, perfumed napkins?&nbsp;
She requires meat only, and hunger is not ambitious.&nbsp; Can we think
no wealth enough but such a state for which a man may be brought into
a premunire, begged, proscribed, or poisoned?&nbsp; O! if a man could
restrain the fury of his gullet and groin, and think how many fires,
how many kitchens, cooks, pastures, and ploughed lands; what orchards,
stews, ponds and parks, coops and garners, he could spare; what velvets,
tissues, embroideries, laces, he could lack; and then how short and
uncertain his life is; he were in a better way to happiness than to
live the emperor of these delights, and be the dictator of fashions;
but we make ourselves slaves to our pleasures, and we serve fame and
ambition, which is an equal slavery.&nbsp; Have not I seen the pomp
of a whole kingdom, and what a foreign king could bring hither?&nbsp;
Also to make himself gazed and wondered at - laid forth, as it were,
to the show - and vanish all away in a day?&nbsp; And shall that which
could not fill the expectation of few hours, entertain and take up our
whole lives, when even it appeared as superfluous to the possessors
as to me that was a spectator?&nbsp; The bravery was shown, it was not
possessed; while it boasted itself it perished.&nbsp; It is vile, and
a poor thing to place our happiness on these desires.&nbsp; Say we wanted
them all.&nbsp; Famine ends famine.<br>
<br>
<i>De mollibus et eff&oelig;minatis</i>. - There is nothing valiant
or solid to be hoped for from such as are always kempt and perfumed,
and every day smell of the tailor; the exceedingly curious that are
wholly in mending such an imperfection in the face, in taking away the
morphew in the neck, or bleaching their hands at midnight, gumming and
bridling their beards, or making the waist small, binding it with hoops,
while the mind runs at waste; too much pickedness is not manly.&nbsp;
Not from those that will jest at their own outward imperfections, but
hide their ulcers within, their pride, lust, envy, ill-nature, with
all the art and authority they can.&nbsp; These persons are in danger,
for whilst they think to justify their ignorance by impudence, and their
persons by clothes and outward ornaments, they use but a commission
to deceive themselves: where, if we will look with our understanding,
and not our senses, we may behold virtue and beauty (though covered
with rags) in their brightness; and vice and deformity so much the fouler,
in having all the splendour of riches to gild them, or the false light
of honour and power to help them.&nbsp; Yet this is that wherewith the
world is taken, and runs mad to gaze on - clothes and titles, the birdlime
of fools.<br>
<br>
<i>De stultiti&acirc;</i>. - What petty things they are we wonder at,
like children that esteem every trifle, and prefer a fairing before
their fathers!&nbsp; What difference is between us and them but that
we are dearer fools, coxcombs at a higher rate?&nbsp; They are pleased
with cockleshells, whistles, hobby-horses, and such like; we with statues,
marble pillars, pictures, gilded roofs, where underneath is lath and
lime, perhaps loam.&nbsp; Yet we take pleasure in the lie, and are glad
we can cozen ourselves.&nbsp; Nor is it only in our walls and ceilings,
but all that we call happiness is mere painting and gilt, and all for
money.&nbsp; What a thin membrane of honour that is! and how hath all
true reputation fallen, since money began to have any!&nbsp; Yet the
great herd, the multitude, that in all other things are divided, in
this alone conspire and agree - to love money.&nbsp; They wish for it,
they embrace it, they adore it, while yet it is possessed with greater
stir and torment than it is gotten.<br>
<br>
<i>De sibi molestis</i>. - Some men what losses soever they have they
make them greater, and if they have none, even all that is not gotten
is a loss.&nbsp; Can there be creatures of more wretched condition than
these, that continually labour under their own misery and others&rsquo;
envy?&nbsp; A man should study other things, not to covet, not to fear,
not to repent him; to make his base such as no tempest shall shake him;
to be secure of all opinion, and pleasing to himself, even for that
wherein he displeaseth others; for the worst opinion gotten for doing
well, should delight us.&nbsp; Wouldst not thou be just but for fame,
thou oughtest to be it with infamy; he that would have his virtue published
is not the servant of virtue, but glory.<br>
<br>
<i>Periculosa melancholia.</i> - It<i> </i>is a dangerous thing when
men&rsquo;s minds come to sojourn with their affections, and their diseases
eat into their strength; that when too much desire and greediness of
vice hath made the body unfit, or unprofitable, it is yet gladded with
the sight and spectacle of it in others; and for want of ability to
be an actor, is content to be a witness.&nbsp; It enjoys the pleasure
of sinning in beholding others sin, as in dining, drinking, drabbing,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Nay, when it cannot do all these, it is offended with
his own narrowness, that excludes it from the universal delights of
mankind, and oftentimes dies of a melancholy, that it cannot be vicious
enough.<br>
<br>
<i>Fals&aelig; species fugiend&aelig;.</i> - I am glad when I see any
man avoid the infamy of a vice; but to shun the vice itself were better.&nbsp;
Till he do that he is but like the &lsquo;pientice, who, being loth
to be spied by his master coming forth of Black Lucy&rsquo;s, went in
again; to whom his master cried, &ldquo;The more thou runnest that way
to hide thyself, the more thou art in the place.&rdquo;&nbsp; So are
those that keep a tavern all day, that they may not be seen at night.&nbsp;
I have known lawyers, divines - yea, great ones - of this heresy.<br>
<br>
<i>Decipimur specie</i>. - There is a greater reverence had of things
remote or strange to us than of much better if they be nearer and fall
under our sense.&nbsp; Men, and almost all sorts of creatures, have
their reputation by distance.&nbsp; Rivers, the farther they run, and
more from their spring, the broader they are, and greater.&nbsp; And
where our original is known, we are less the confident; among strangers
we trust fortune.&nbsp; Yet a man may live as renowned at home, in his
own country, or a private village, as in the whole world.&nbsp; For
it is virtue that gives glory; that will endenizen a man everywhere.&nbsp;
It is only that can naturalise him.&nbsp; A native, if he be vicious,
deserves to be a stranger, and cast out of the commonwealth as an alien.<br>
<br>
<i>Dejectio Aulic.</i> - A dejected countenance and mean clothes beget
often a contempt, but it is with the shallowest creatures; courtiers
commonly: look up even with them in a new suit, you get above them straight.&nbsp;
Nothing is more short-lived than pride; it is but while their clothes
last: stay but while these are worn out, you cannot wish the thing more
wretched or dejected.<br>
<br>
<i>Poesis</i>,<i> et pictura.</i> - <i>Plutarch.&nbsp; </i>Poetry and
picture are arts of a like nature, and both are busy about imitation.&nbsp;
It was excellently said of Plutarch, poetry was a speaking picture,
and picture a mute poesy.&nbsp; For they both invent, feign and devise
many things, and accommodate all they invent to the use and service
of Nature.&nbsp; Yet of the two, the pen is more noble than the pencil;
for that can speak to the understanding, the other but to the sense.&nbsp;
They both behold pleasure and profit as their common object; but should
abstain from all base pleasures, lest they should err from their end,
and, while they seek to better men&rsquo;s minds, destroy their manners.&nbsp;
They both are born artificers, not made.&nbsp; Nature is more powerful
in them than study.<br>
<br>
<i>De pictura</i>. - Whosoever loves not picture is injurious to truth
and all the wisdom of poetry.&nbsp; Picture is the invention of heaven,
the most ancient and most akin to Nature.&nbsp; It is itself a silent
work, and always of one and the same habit; yet it doth so enter and
penetrate the inmost affection (being done by an excellent artificer)
as sometimes it overcomes the power of speech and oratory.&nbsp; There
are divers graces in it, so are there in the artificers.&nbsp; One excels
in care, another in reason, a third in easiness, a fourth in nature
and grace.&nbsp; Some have diligence and comeliness, but they want majesty.&nbsp;
They can express a human form in all the graces, sweetness, and elegancy,
but, they miss the authority.&nbsp; They can hit nothing but smooth
cheeks; they cannot express roughness or gravity.&nbsp; Others aspire
to truth so much as they are rather lovers of likeness than beauty.&nbsp;
Zeuxis and Parrhasius are said to be contemporaries; the first found
out the reason of lights and shadows in picture, the other more subtlely
examined the line.<br>
<br>
<i>De stylo.</i> - <i>Pliny.</i> - In picture light is required no less
than shadow; so in style, height as well as humbleness.&nbsp; But beware
they be not too humble, as Pliny pronounced of Regulus&rsquo;s writings.&nbsp;
You would think them written, not on a child, but by a child.&nbsp;
Many, out of their own obscene apprehensions, refuse proper and fit
words - as occupy, Nature, and the like; so the curious industry in
some, of having all alike good, hath come nearer a vice than a virtue.<br>
<br>
<i>De progres. pictur&aelig;</i>. <a name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93">{93}</a>&nbsp;
Picture took her feigning from poetry; from geometry her rule, compass,
lines, proportion, and the whole symmetry.&nbsp; Parrhasius was the
first won reputation by adding symmetry to picture; he added subtlety
to the countenance, elegancy to the hair, love-lines to the face, and
by the public voice of all artificers, deserved honour in the outer
lines.&nbsp; Eupompus gave it splendour by numbers and other elegancies.&nbsp;
From the optics it drew reasons, by which it considered how things placed
at distance and afar off should appear less; how above or beneath the
head should deceive the eye, &amp;c.&nbsp; So from thence it took shadows,
recessor, light, and heightnings.&nbsp; From moral philosophy it took
the soul, the expression of senses, perturbations, manners, when they
would paint an angry person, a proud, an inconstant, an ambitious, a
brave, a magnanimous, a just, a merciful, a compassionate, an humble,
a dejected, a base, and the like; they made all heightnings bright,
all shadows dark, all swellings from a plane, all solids from breaking.&nbsp;
See where he complains of their painting Chim&aelig;ras <a name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94">{94}</a>
(by the vulgar unaptly called grotesque) saying that men who were born
truly to study and emulate Nature did nothing but make monsters against
Nature, which Horace so laughed at. <a name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95">{95}</a>
The art plastic was moulding in clay, or potter&rsquo;s earth anciently.&nbsp;
This is the parent of statuary, sculpture, graving, and picture; cutting
in brass and marble, all serve under her.&nbsp; Socrates taught Parrhasius
and Clito (two noble statuaries) first to express manners by their looks
in imagery.&nbsp; Polygnotus and Aglaophon were ancienter.&nbsp; After
them Zeuxis, who was the lawgiver to all painters; after, Parrhasius.&nbsp;
They were contemporaries, and lived both about Philip&rsquo;s time,
the father of Alexander the Great.&nbsp; There lived in this latter
age six famous painters in Italy, who were excellent and emulous of
the ancients - Raphael de Urbino, Michael Angelo Buonarotti, Titian,
Antony of Correggio, Sebastian of Venice, Julio Romano, and Andrea Sartorio.<br>
<br>
<i>Parasiti ad mensam.</i> - These are flatterers for their bread, that
praise all my oraculous lord does or says, be it true or false; invent
tales that shall please; make baits for his lordship&rsquo;s ears; and
if they be not received in what they offer at, they shift a point of
the compass, and turn their tale, presently tack about, deny what they
confessed, and confess what they denied; fit their discourse to the
persons and occasions.&nbsp; What they snatch up and devour at one table,
utter at another; and grow suspected of the master, hated of the servants,
while they inquire, and reprehend, and compound, and dilate business
of the house they have nothing to do with.&nbsp; They praise my lord&rsquo;s
wine and the sauce he likes; observe the cook and bottle-man; while
they stand in my lord&rsquo;s favour, speak for a pension for them,
but pound them to dust upon my lord&rsquo;s least distaste, or change
of his palate.<br>
<br>
How much better is it to be silent, or at least to speak sparingly!
for it is not enough to speak good, but timely things.&nbsp; If a man
be asked a question, to answer; but to repeat the question before he
answer is well, that he be sure to understand it, to avoid absurdity;
for it is less dishonour to hear imperfectly than to speak imperfectly.&nbsp;
The ears are excused, the understanding is not.&nbsp; And in things
unknown to a man, not to give his opinion, lest by the affectation of
knowing too much he lose the credit he hath, by speaking or knowing
the wrong way what he utters.&nbsp; Nor seek to get his patron&rsquo;s
favour by embarking himself in the factions of the family, to inquire
after domestic simulties, their sports or affections.&nbsp; They are
an odious and vile kind of creatures, that fly about the house all day,
and picking up the filth of the house like pies or swallows, carry it
to their nest (the lord&rsquo;s ears), and oftentimes report the lies
they have feigned for what they have seen and heard,<br>
<br>
<i>Im&ograve; serviles</i>. - These are called instruments of grace
and power with great persons, but they are indeed the organs of their
impotency, and marks of weakness.&nbsp; For sufficient lords are able
to make these discoveries themselves.&nbsp; Neither will an honourable
person inquire who eats and drinks together, what that man plays, whom
this man loves, with whom such a one walks, what discourse they hold,
who sleeps with whom.&nbsp; They are base and servile natures that busy
themselves about these disquisitions.&nbsp; How often have I seen (and
worthily) these censors of the family undertaken by some honest rustic
and cudgelled thriftily!&nbsp; These are commonly the off-scouring and
dregs of men that do these things, or calumniate others; yet I know
not truly which is worse - he that maligns all, or that praises all.&nbsp;
There is as a vice in praising, and as frequent, as in detracting.<br>
<br>
It pleased your lordship of late to ask my opinion touching the education
of your sons, and especially to the advancement of their studies.&nbsp;
To which, though I returned somewhat for the present, which rather manifested
a will in me than gave any just resolution to the thing propounded,
I have upon better cogitation called those aids about me, both of mind
and memory, which shall venture my thoughts clearer, if not fuller,
to your lordship&rsquo;s demand.&nbsp; I confess, my lord, they will
seem but petty and minute things I shall offer to you, being writ for
children, and of them.&nbsp; But studies have their infancy as well
as creatures.&nbsp; We see in men even the strongest compositions had
their beginnings from milk and the cradle; and the wisest tarried sometimes
about apting their mouths to letters and syllables.&nbsp; In their education,
therefore, the care must be the greater had of their beginnings, to
know, examine, and weigh their natures; which, though they be proner
in some children to some disciplines, yet are they naturally prompt
to taste all by degrees, and with change.&nbsp; For change is a kind
of refreshing in studies, and infuseth knowledge by way of recreation.&nbsp;
Thence the school itself is called a play or game, and all letters are
so best taught to scholars.&nbsp; They should not be affrighted or deterred
in their entry, but drawn on with exercise and emulation.&nbsp; A youth
should not be made to hate study before he know the causes to love it,
or taste the bitterness before the sweet; but called on and allured,
entreated and praised - yea, when he deserves it not.&nbsp; For which
cause I wish them sent to the best school, and a public, which I think
the best.&nbsp; Your lordship, I fear, hardly hears of that, as willing
to breed them in your eye and at home, and doubting their manners may
be corrupted abroad.&nbsp; They are in more danger in your own family,
among ill servants (allowing they be safe in their schoolmaster), than
amongst a thousand boys, however immodest.&nbsp; Would we did not spoil
our own children, and overthrow their manners ourselves by too much
indulgence!&nbsp; To breed them at home is to breed them in a shade,
whereas in a school they have the light and heat of the sun.&nbsp; They
are used and accustomed to things and men.&nbsp; When they come forth
into the common-wealth, they find nothing new, or to seek.&nbsp; They
have made their friendships and aids, some to last their age.&nbsp;
They hear what is commanded to others as well as themselves; much approved,
much corrected; all which they bring to their own store and use, and
learn as much as they hear.&nbsp; Eloquence would be but a poor thing
if we should only converse with singulars, speak but man and man together.&nbsp;
Therefore I like no private breeding.&nbsp; I would send them where
their industry should be daily increased by praise, and that kindled
by emulation.&nbsp; It is a good thing to inflame the mind; and though
ambition itself be a vice, it is often the cause of great virtue.&nbsp;
Give me that wit whom praise excites, glory puts on, or disgrace grieves;
he is to be nourished with ambition, pricked forward with honour, checked
with reprehension, and never to be suspected of sloth.&nbsp; Though
he be given to play, it is a sign of spirit and liveliness, so there
be a mean had of their sports and relaxations.&nbsp; And from the rod
or ferule I would have them free, as from the menace of them; for it
is both deformed and servile.<br>
<br>
<i>De stylo</i>,<i> et optimo scribendi genere.</i> - For a man to write
well, there are required three necessaries - to read the best authors,
observe the best speakers, and much exercise of his own style; in style
to consider what ought to be written, and after what manner.&nbsp; He
must first think and excogitate his matter, then choose his words, and
examine the weight of either.&nbsp; Then take care, in placing and ranking
both matter and words, that the composition be comely; and to do this
with diligence and often.&nbsp; No matter how slow the style be at first,
so it be laboured and accurate; seek the best, and be not glad of the
froward conceits, or first words, that offer themselves to us; but judge
of what we invent, and order what we approve.&nbsp; Repeat often what
we have formerly written; which beside that it helps the consequence,
and makes the juncture better, it quickens the heat of imagination,
that often cools in the time of setting down, and gives it new strength,
as if it grew lustier by the going back; as we see in the contention
of leaping, they jump farthest that fetch their race largest; or, as
in throwing a dart or javelin, we force back our arms to make our loose
the stronger.&nbsp; Yet, if we have a fair gale of wind, I forbid not
the steering out of our sail, so the favour of the gale deceive us not.&nbsp;
For all that we invent doth please us in conception of birth, else we
would never set it down.&nbsp; But the safest is to return to our judgment,
and handle over again those things the easiness of which might make
them justly suspected.&nbsp; So did the best writers in their beginnings;
they imposed upon themselves care and industry; they did nothing rashly:
they obtained first to write well, and then custom made it easy and
a habit.&nbsp; By little and little their matter showed itself to them
more plentifully; their words answered, their composition followed;
and all, as in a well-ordered family, presented itself in the place.&nbsp;
So that the sum of all is, ready writing makes not good writing, but
good writing brings on ready writing yet, when we think we have got
the faculty, it is even then good to resist it, as to give a horse a
check sometimes with a bit, which doth not so much stop his course as
stir his mettle.&nbsp; Again, whether a man&rsquo;s genius is best able
to reach thither, it should more and more contend, lift and dilate itself,
as men of low stature raise themselves on their toes, and so ofttimes
get even, if not eminent.&nbsp; Besides, as it is fit for grown and
able writers to stand of themselves, and work with their own strength,
to trust and endeavour by their own faculties, so it is fit for the
beginner and learner to study others and the best.&nbsp; For the mind
and memory are more sharply exercised in comprehending another man&rsquo;s
things than our own; and such as accustom themselves and are familiar
with the best authors shall ever and anon find somewhat of them in themselves,
and in the expression of their minds, even when they feel it not, be
able to utter something like theirs, which hath an authority above their
own.&nbsp; Nay, sometimes it is the reward of a man&rsquo;s study, the
praise of quoting another man fitly; and though a man be more prone
and able for one kind of writing than another, yet he must exercise
all.&nbsp; For as in an instrument, so in style, there must be a harmony
and consent of parts.<br>
<br>
<i>Pr&aelig;cipiendi modi.</i> - I take this labour in teaching others,
that they should not be always to be taught, and I would bring my precepts
into practice, for rules are ever of less force and value than experiments;
yet with this purpose, rather to show the right way to those that come
after, than to detect any that have slipped before by error, and I hope
it will be more profitable.&nbsp; For men do more willingly listen,
and with more favour, to precept, than reprehension.&nbsp; Among divers
opinions of an art, and most of them contrary in themselves, it is hard
to make election; and, therefore, though a man cannot invent new things
after so many, he may do a welcome work yet to help posterity to judge
rightly of the old.&nbsp; But arts and precepts avail nothing, except
Nature be beneficial and aiding.&nbsp; And therefore these things are
no more written to a dull disposition, than rules of husbandry to a
soil.&nbsp; No precepts will profit a fool, no more than beauty will
the blind, or music the deaf.&nbsp; As we should take care that our
style in writing be neither dry nor empty, we should look again it be
not winding, or wanton with far-fetched descriptions; either is a vice.&nbsp;
But that is worse which proceeds out of want, than that which riots
out of plenty.&nbsp; The remedy of fruitfulness is easy, but no labour
will help the contrary; I will like and praise some things in a young
writer which yet, if he continue in, I cannot but justly hate him for
the same.&nbsp; There is a time to be given all things for maturity,
and that even your country husband-man can teach, who to a young plant
will not put the pruning-knife, because it seems to fear the iron, as
not able to admit the scar.&nbsp; No more would I tell a green writer
all his faults, lest I should make him grieve and faint, and at last
despair; for nothing doth more hurt than to make him so afraid of all
things as he can endeavour nothing.&nbsp; Therefore youth ought to be
instructed betimes, and in the best things; for we hold those longest
we take soonest, as the first scent of a vessel lasts, and the tint
the wool first receives; therefore a master should temper his own powers,
and descend to the other&rsquo;s infirmity.&nbsp; If you pour a glut
of water upon a bottle, it receives little of it; but with a funnel,
and by degrees, you shall fill many of them, and spill little of your
own; to their capacity they will all receive and be full.&nbsp; And
as it is fit to read the best authors to youth first, so let them be
of the openest and clearest. <a name="citation106a"></a><a href="#footnote106a">{106a}</a>&nbsp;
As Livy before Sallust, Sidney before Donne; and beware of letting them
taste Gower or Chaucer at first, lest, falling too much in love with
antiquity, and not apprehending the weight, they grow rough and barren
in language only.&nbsp; When their judgments are firm, and out of danger,
let them read both the old and the new; but no less take heed that their
new flowers and sweetness do not as much corrupt as the others&rsquo;
dryness and squalor, if they choose not carefully.&nbsp; Spenser, in
affecting the ancients, writ no language; yet I would have him read
for his matter, but as Virgil read Ennius.&nbsp; The reading of Homer
and Virgil is counselled by Quintilian as the best way of informing
youth and confirming man.&nbsp; For, besides that the mind is raised
with the height and sublimity of such a verse, it takes spirit from
the greatness of the matter, and is tinctured with the best things.&nbsp;
Tragic and lyric poetry is good, too, and comic with the best, if the
manners of the reader be once in safety.&nbsp; In the Greek poets, as
also in Plautus, we shall see the economy and disposition of poems better
observed than in Terence; and the latter, who thought the sole grace
and virtue of their fable the sticking in of sentences, as ours do the
forcing in of jests.<br>
<br>
<i>Fals. querel. fugiend. Platonis peregrinatio in Italiam.</i> - We<i>
</i>should not protect our sloth with the patronage of difficulty.&nbsp;
It is a false quarrel against Nature, that she helps understanding but
in a few, when the most part of mankind are inclined by her thither,
if they would take the pains; no less than birds to fly, horses to run,
&amp;c., which if they lose, it is through their own sluggishness, and
by that means become her prodigies, not her children.&nbsp; I confess,
Nature in children is more patient of labour in study than in age; for
the sense of the pain, the judgment of the labour is absent; they do
not measure what they have done.&nbsp; And it is the thought and consideration
that affects us more than the weariness itself.&nbsp; Plato was not
content with the learning that Athens could give him, but sailed into
Italy, for Pythagoras&rsquo; knowledge: and yet not thinking himself
sufficiently informed, went into Egypt, to the priests, and learned
their mysteries.&nbsp; He laboured, so must we.&nbsp; Many things may
be learned together, and performed in one point of time; as musicians
exercise their memory, their voice, their fingers, and sometimes their
head and feet at once.&nbsp; And so a preacher, in the invention of
matter, election of words, composition of gesture, look, pronunciation,
motion, useth all these faculties at once: and if we can express this
variety together, why should not divers studies, at divers hours, delight,
when the variety is able alone to refresh and repair us?&nbsp; As, when
a man is weary of writing, to read; and then again of reading, to write.&nbsp;
Wherein, howsoever we do many things, yet are we (in a sort) still fresh
to what we begin; we are recreated with change, as the stomach is with
meats.&nbsp; But some will say this variety breeds confusion, and makes,
that either we lose all, or hold no more than the last.&nbsp; Why do
we not then persuade husbandmen that they should not till land, help
it with marl, lime, and compost? plant hop-gardens, prune trees, look
to bee-hives, rear sheep, and all other cattle at once?&nbsp; It is
easier to do many things and continue, than to do one thing long.<br>
<br>
<i>Pr&aelig;cept. element.</i> - It is not the passing through these
learnings that hurts us, but the dwelling and sticking about them.&nbsp;
To descend to those extreme anxieties and foolish cavils of grammarians,
is able to break a wit in pieces, being a work of manifold misery and
vainness, to be <i>elementarii senes</i>.&nbsp; Yet even letters are,
as it were, the bank of words, and restore themselves to an author as
the pawns of language: but talking and eloquence are not the same: to
speak, and to speak well, are two things.&nbsp; A fool may talk, but
a wise man speaks; and out of the observation, knowledge, and the use
of things, many writers perplex their readers and hearers with mere
nonsense.&nbsp; Their writings need sunshine.&nbsp; Pure and neat language
I love, yet plain and customary.&nbsp; A barbarous phrase has often
made me out of love with a good sense, and doubtful writing hath wracked
me beyond my patience.&nbsp; The reason why a poet is said that he ought
to have all knowledges is, that he should not be ignorant of the most,
especially of those he will handle.&nbsp; And indeed, when the attaining
of them is possible, it were a sluggish and base thing to despair; for
frequent imitation of anything becomes a habit quickly.&nbsp; If a man
should prosecute as much as could be said of everything, his work would
find no end.<br>
<br>
<i>De orationis dignitate.</i>&nbsp; &rsquo;&Epsilon;&gamma;&kappa;&upsilon;&kappa;&lambda;&omicron;&pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;.
- <i>Metaphora</i>.&nbsp; Speech is the only benefit man hath to express
his excellency of mind above other creatures.&nbsp; It is the instrument
of society; therefore Mercury, who is the president of language, is
called <i>deorum hominumque interpres</i>. <a name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a">{110a}</a>&nbsp;
In all speech, words and sense are as the body and the soul.&nbsp; The
sense is as the life and soul of language, without which all words are
dead.&nbsp; Sense is wrought out of experience, the knowledge of human
life and actions, or of the liberal arts, which the Greeks called &rsquo;&Epsilon;&gamma;&kappa;&upsilon;&kappa;&lambda;&omicron;&pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;&nu;.&nbsp;
Words are the people&rsquo;s, yet there is a choice of them to be made;
for <i>verborum delectus origo est eloquenti&aelig;</i>. <a name="citation111a"></a><a href="#footnote111a">{111a}</a>&nbsp;
They are to be chosen according to the persons we make speak, or the
things we speak of.&nbsp; Some are of the camp, some of the council-board,
some of the shop, some of the sheepcote, some of the pulpit, some of
the Bar, &amp;c.&nbsp; And herein is seen their elegance and propriety,
when we use them fitly and draw them forth to their just strength and
nature by way of translation or metaphor.&nbsp; But in this translation
we must only serve necessity <i>(nam temer&egrave; nihil transfertur
&agrave; prudenti) </i><a name="citation111b"></a><a href="#footnote111b">{111b}</a>
or commodity, which is a kind of necessity: that is, when we either
absolutely want a word to express by, and that is necessity; or when
we have not so fit a word, and that is commodity; as when we avoid loss
by it, and escape obsceneness, and gain in the grace and property which
helps significance.&nbsp; Metaphors far-fetched hinder to be understood;
and affected, lose their grace.&nbsp; Or when the person fetcheth his
translations from a wrong place as if a privy councillor should at the
table take his metaphor from a dicing-house, or ordinary, or a vintner&rsquo;s
vault; or a justice of peace draw his similitudes from the mathematics,
or a divine from a bawdy house, or taverns; or a gentleman of Northamptonshire,
Warwickshire, or the Midland, should fetch all the illustrations to
his country neighbours from shipping, and tell them of the main-sheet
and the bowline.&nbsp; Metaphors are thus many times deformed, as in
him that said, <i>Castratam morte Africani rempublicam; </i>and another,
<i>Stercus curi&aelig; Glauciam</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Can&acirc; nive conspuit
Alpes.&nbsp; </i>All attempts that are new in this kind, are dangerous,
and somewhat hard, before they be softened with use.&nbsp; A man coins
not a new word without some peril and less fruit; for if it happen to
be received, the praise is but moderate; if refused, the scorn is assured.&nbsp;
Yet we must adventure; for things at first hard and rough are by use
made tender and gentle.&nbsp; It is an honest error that is committed,
following great chiefs.<br>
<br>
<i>Consuetudo. - Perspicuitas</i>,<i> Venustas.</i> - <i>Authoritas.</i>
- <i>Virgil.</i> - <i>Lucretius. - Chaucerism.</i> - <i>Paronomasia</i>.
- Custom is the most certain mistress of language, as the public stamp
makes the current money.&nbsp; But we must not be too frequent with
the mint, every day coining, nor fetch words from the extreme and utmost
ages; since the chief virtue of a style is perspicuity, and nothing
so vicious in it as to need an interpreter.&nbsp; Words borrowed of
antiquity do lend a kind of majesty to style, and are not without their
delight sometimes; for they have the authority of years, and out of
their intermission do win themselves a kind of grace like newness.&nbsp;
But the eldest of the present, and newness of the past language, is
the best.&nbsp; For what was the ancient language, which some men so
dote upon, but the ancient custom?&nbsp; Yet when I name custom, I understand
not the vulgar custom; for that were a precept no less dangerous to
language than life, if we should speak or live after the manners of
the vulgar: but that I call custom of speech, which is the consent of
the learned; as custom of life, which is the consent of the good.&nbsp;
Virgil was most loving of antiquity; yet how rarely doth he insert <i>aquai
</i>and <i>pictai</i>!&nbsp; Lucretius is scabrous and rough in these;
he seeks them: as some do Chaucerisms with us, which were better expunged
and banished.&nbsp; Some words are to be culled out for ornament and
colour, as we gather flowers to strew houses or make garlands; but they
are better when they grow to our style; as in a meadow, where, though
the mere grass and greenness delight, yet the variety of flowers doth
heighten and beautify.&nbsp; Marry, we must not play or riot too much
with them, as in Paronomasies; nor use too swelling or ill-sounding
words!&nbsp; <i>Qu&aelig; per salebras</i>,<i> altaque saxa cadunt</i>.
<a name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a">{114a}</a>&nbsp;
It is true, there is no sound but shall find some lovers, as the bitterest
confections are grateful to some palates.&nbsp; Our composition must
be more accurate in the beginning and end than in the midst, and in
the end more than in the beginning; for through the midst the stream
bears us.&nbsp; And this is attained by custom, more than care of diligence.&nbsp;
We must express readily and fully, not profusely.&nbsp; There is difference
between a liberal and prodigal hand.&nbsp; As it is a great point of
art, when our matter requires it, to enlarge and veer out all sail,
so to take it in and contract it, is of no less praise, when the argument
doth ask it.&nbsp; Either of them hath their fitness in the place.&nbsp;
A good man always profits by his endeavour, by his help, yea, when he
is absent; nay, when he is dead, by his example and memory.&nbsp; So
good authors in their style: a strict and succinct style is that where
you can take away nothing without loss, and that loss to be manifest.<br>
<br>
<i>De Stylo.</i> - <i>Tracitus.</i> - <i>The Laconic. - Suetonius. </i>-
<i>Seneca and Fabianus.</i> - The brief style is that which expresseth
much in little; the concise style, which expresseth not enough, but
leaves somewhat to be understood; the abrupt style, which hath many
breaches, and doth not seem to end, but fall.&nbsp; The congruent and
harmonious fitting of parts in a sentence hath almost the fastening
and force of knitting and connection; as in stones well squared, which
will rise strong a great way without mortar.<br>
<br>
<i>Periodi.</i> - <i>Obscuritas offundit tenebras.</i> - <i>Superlatio.</i>
- Periods are beautiful when they are not too long; for so they have
their strength too, as in a pike or javelin.&nbsp; As we must take the
care that our words and sense be clear, so if the obscurity happen through
the hearer&rsquo;s or reader&rsquo;s want of understanding, I am not
to answer for them, no more than for their not listening or marking;
I must neither find them ears nor mind.&nbsp; But a man cannot put a
word so in sense but something about it will illustrate it, if the writer
understand himself; for order helps much to perspicuity, as confusion
hurts.&nbsp; (<i>Rectitudo lucem adfert; obliquitas et circumductio
offuscat</i>. <a name="citation116a"></a><a href="#footnote116a">{116a}</a>)&nbsp;
We should therefore speak what we can the nearest way, so as we keep
our gait, not leap; for too short may as well be not let into the memory,
as too long not kept in.&nbsp; Whatsoever loseth the grace and clearness,
converts into a riddle; the obscurity is marked, but not the value.&nbsp;
That perisheth, and is passed by, like the pearl in the fable.&nbsp;
Our style should be like a skein of silk, to be carried and found by
the right thread, not ravelled and perplexed; then all is a knot, a
heap.&nbsp; There are words that do as much raise a style as others
can depress it.&nbsp; Superlation and over-muchness amplifies; it may
be above faith, but never above a mean.&nbsp; It was ridiculous in Cestius,
when he said of Alexander:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Fremit oceanus, quasi indignetur, qu&ograve;d terras relinquas.&rdquo;
<a name="citation117a"></a><a href="#footnote117a">{117a}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
But propitiously from Virgil:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Credas innare revulsas<br>
Cycladas.&rdquo; <a name="citation117b"></a><a href="#footnote117b">{117b}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
He doth not say it was so, but seemed to be so.&nbsp; Although it be
somewhat incredible, that is excused before it be spoken.&nbsp; But
there are hyperboles which will become one language, that will by no
means admit another.&nbsp; As <i>Eos esse </i>P. R. <i>exercitus</i>,<i>
qui c&aelig;lum possint perrumpere</i>, <a name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a">{118a}</a>
who would say with us, but a madman?&nbsp; Therefore we must consider
in every tongue what is used, what received.&nbsp; Quintilian warns
us, that in no kind of translation, or metaphor, or allegory, we make
a turn from what we began; as if we fetch the original of our metaphor
from sea and billows, we end not in flames and ashes: it is a most foul
inconsequence.&nbsp; Neither must we draw out our allegory too long,
lest either we make ourselves obscure, or fall into affectation, which
is childish.&nbsp; But why do men depart at all from the right and natural
ways of speaking? sometimes for necessity, when we are driven, or think
it fitter, to speak that in obscure words, or by circumstance, which
uttered plainly would offend the hearers.&nbsp; Or to avoid obsceneness,
or sometimes for pleasure, and variety, as travellers turn out of the
highway, drawn either by the commodity of a footpath, or the delicacy
or freshness of the fields.&nbsp; And all this is called &epsilon;&sigma;&chi;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&eta;
or figured language.<br>
<br>
<i>Oratio imago animi</i>. - Language most shows a man: Speak, that
I may see thee.&nbsp; It springs out of the most retired and inmost
parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind.&nbsp; No
glass renders a man&rsquo;s form or likeness so true as his speech.&nbsp;
Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition
in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure,
and harmony of it.<br>
<br>
<i>Structura et statura</i>,<i> sublimis</i>,<i> humilis</i>,<i> pumila.</i>
- Some men are tall and big, so some language is high and great.&nbsp;
Then the words are chosen, their sound ample, the composition full,
the absolution plenteous, and poured out, all grave, sinewy, and strong.&nbsp;
Some are little and dwarfs; so of speech, it is humble and low, the
words poor and flat, the members and periods thin and weak, without
knitting or number.<br>
<br>
<i>Mediocris plana et placida.</i> - The middle are of a just stature.&nbsp;
There the language is plain and pleasing; even without stopping, round
without swelling: all well-turned, composed, elegant, and accurate.<br>
<br>
<i>Vitiosa oratio</i>,<i> vasta</i> - <i>tumens</i> - <i>enormis - affectata</i>
- <i>abjecta</i>. - The vicious language is vast and gaping, swelling
and irregular: when it contends to be high, full of rock, mountain,
and pointedness; as it affects to be low, it is abject, and creeps,
full of bogs and holes.&nbsp; And according to their subject these styles
vary, and lose their names: for that which is high and lofty, declaring
excellent matter, becomes vast and tumorous, speaking of petty and inferior
things; so that which was even and apt in a mean and plain subject,
will appear most poor and humble in a high argument.&nbsp; Would you
not laugh to meet a great councillor of State in a flat cap, with his
trunk hose, and a hobbyhorse cloak, his gloves under his girdle, and
yond haberdasher in a velvet gown, furred with sables?&nbsp; There is
a certain latitude in these things, by which we find the degrees.<br>
<br>
<i>Figura.</i> - The<i> </i>next thing to the stature, is the figure
and feature in language - that is, whether it be round and straight,
which consists of short and succinct periods, numerous and polished;
or square and firm, which is to have equal and strong parts everywhere
answerable, and weighed.<br>
<br>
<i>Cutis sive cortex.&nbsp; Compositio.</i> - The third is the skin
and coat, which rests in the well-joining, cementing, and coagmentation
of words; whenas it is smooth, gentle, and sweet, like a table upon
which you may run your finger without rubs, and your nail cannot find
a joint; not horrid, rough, wrinkled, gaping, or chapped: after these,
the flesh, blood, and bones come in question.<br>
<br>
<i>Carnosa</i> - <i>adipata</i> - <i>redundans.</i> - We say it is a
fleshy style, when there is much periphrasis, and circuit of words;
and when with more than enough, it grows fat and corpulent: <i>arvina
orationis</i>,<i> </i>full of suet and tallow.&nbsp; It hath blood and
juice when the words are proper and apt, their sound sweet, and the
phrase neat and picked - <i>oratio uncta</i>,<i> et ben&egrave; pasta.&nbsp;
</i>But where there is redundancy, both the blood and juice are faulty
and vicious:- <i>Redundat sanguine</i>,<i> quia multo plus dicit</i>,<i>
quam necesse est.&nbsp; </i>Juice in language is somewhat less than
blood; for if the words be but becoming and signifying, and the sense
gentle, there is juice; but where that wanteth, the language is thin,
flagging, poor, starved, scarce covering the bone, and shows like stones
in a sack.<br>
<br>
<i>Jejuna</i>,<i> macilenta</i>,<i> strigosa.</i> - <i>Ossea</i>,<i>
et nervosa.</i> - Some men, to avoid redundancy, run into that; and
while they strive to have no ill blood or juice, they lose their good.&nbsp;
There be some styles, again, that have not less blood, but less flesh
and corpulence.&nbsp; These are bony and sinewy; <i>Ossa habent</i>,<i>
et nervos.<br>
<br>
Not&aelig; domini Sti. Albani de doctrin. intemper.</i> - <i>Dictator.</i>
- <i>Aristoteles.</i> - It was well noted by the late Lord St. Albans,
that the study of words is the first distemper of learning; vain matter
the second; and a third distemper is deceit, or the likeness of truth:
imposture held up by credulity.&nbsp; All these are the cobwebs of learning,
and to let them grow in us is either sluttish or foolish.&nbsp; Nothing
is more ridiculous than to make an author a dictator, as the schools
have done Aristotle.&nbsp; The damage is infinite knowledge receives
by it; for to many things a man should owe but a temporary belief, and
suspension of his own judgment, not an absolute resignation of himself,
or a perpetual captivity.&nbsp; Let Aristotle and others have their
dues; but if we can make farther discoveries of truth and fitness than
they, why are we envied?&nbsp; Let us beware, while we strive to add,
we do not diminish or deface; we may improve, but not augment.&nbsp;
By discrediting falsehood, truth grows in request.&nbsp; We must not
go about, like men anguished and perplexed, for vicious affectation
of praise, but calmly study the separation of opinions, find the errors
have intervened, awake antiquity, call former times into question; but
make no parties with the present, nor follow any fierce undertakers,
mingle no matter of doubtful credit with the simplicity of truth, but
gently stir the mould about the root of the question, and avoid all
digladiations, facility of credit, or superstitious simplicity, seek
the consonancy and concatenation of truth; stoop only to point of necessity,
and what leads to convenience.&nbsp; Then make exact animadversion where
style hath degenerated, where flourished and thrived in choiceness of
phrase, round and clean composition of sentence, sweet falling of the
clause, varying an illustration by tropes and figures, weight of matter,
worth of subject, soundness of argument, life of invention, and depth
of judgment.&nbsp; This is <i>monte potiri</i>,<i> </i>to get the hill;
for no perfect discovery can be made upon a flat or a level.<br>
<br>
<i>De optimo scriptore.</i> - <i>Cicero.</i> - Now that I have informed
you in the knowing of these things, let me lead you by the hand a little
farther, in the direction of the use, and make you an able writer by
practice.&nbsp; The conceits of the mind are pictures of things, and
the tongue is the interpreter of those pictures.&nbsp; The order of
God&rsquo;s creatures in themselves is not only admirable and glorious,
but eloquent: then he who could apprehend the consequence of things
in their truth, and utter his apprehensions as truly, were the best
writer or speaker.&nbsp; Therefore Cicero said much, when he said, <i>Dicere
recte nemo potest</i>,<i> nisi qui prudenter intelligit</i>. <a name="citation124a"></a><a href="#footnote124a">{124a}</a>&nbsp;
The shame of speaking unskilfully were small if the tongue only thereby
were disgraced; but as the image of a king in his seal ill-represented
is not so much a blemish to the wax, or the signet that sealed it, as
to the prince it representeth, so disordered speech is not so much injury
to the lips that give it forth, as to the disproportion and incoherence
of things in themselves, so negligently expressed.&nbsp; Neither can
his mind be thought to be in tune, whose words do jar; nor his reason
in frame, whose sentence is preposterous; nor his elocution clear and
perfect, whose utterance breaks itself into fragments and uncertainties.&nbsp;
Were it not a dishonour to a mighty prince, to have the majesty of his
embassage spoiled by a careless ambassador? and is it not as great an
indignity, that an excellent conceit and capacity, by the indiligence
of an idle tongue, should be disgraced?&nbsp; Negligent speech doth
not only discredit the person of the speaker, but it discrediteth the
opinion of his reason and judgment; it discrediteth the force and uniformity
of the matter and substance.&nbsp; If it be so then in words, which
fly and escape censure, and where one good phrase begs pardon for many
incongruities and faults, how shall he then be thought wise whose penning
is thin and shallow? how shall you look for wit from him whose leisure
and head, assisted with the examination of his eyes, yield you no life
or sharpness in his writing?<br>
<br>
<i>De stylo epistolari.</i> - <i>Inventio.</i> - In<i> </i>writing there
is to be regarded the invention and the fashion.&nbsp; For the invention,
that ariseth upon your business, whereof there can be no rules of more
certainty, or precepts of better direction given, than conjecture can
lay down from the several occasions of men&rsquo;s particular lives
and vocations: but sometimes men make baseness of kindness: As &ldquo;I
could not satisfy myself till I had discharged my remembrance, and charged
my letters with commendation to you;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;My business is
no other than to testify my love to you, and to put you in mind of my
willingness to do you all kind offices;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Sir, have
you leisure to descend to the remembering of that assurance you have
long possessed in your servant, and upon your next opportunity make
him happy with some commands from you?&rdquo; or the like; that go a-begging
for some meaning, and labour to be delivered of the great burden of
nothing.&nbsp; When you have invented, and that your business be matter,
and not bare form, or mere ceremony, but some earnest, then are you
to proceed to the ordering of it, and digesting the parts, which is
had out of two circumstances.&nbsp; One is the understanding of the
persons to whom you are to write; the other is the coherence of your
sentence; for men&rsquo;s capacity to weigh what will be apprehended
with greatest attention or leisure; what next regarded and longed for
especially, and what last will leave satisfaction, and (as it were)
the sweetest memorial and belief of all that is passed in his understanding
whom you write to.&nbsp; For the consequence of sentences, you must
be sure that every clause do give the cue one to the other, and be bespoken
ere it come.&nbsp; So much for invention and order.<br>
<br>
<i>Modus.</i> - 1<i>.&nbsp; Brevitas.</i> - Now for fashion: it consists
in four things, which are qualities of your style.&nbsp; The first is
brevity; for they must not be treatises or discourses (your letters)
except it be to learned men.&nbsp; And even among them there is a kind
of thrift and saving of words.&nbsp; Therefore you are to examine the
clearest passages of your understanding, and through them to convey
the sweetest and most significant words you can devise, that you may
the easier teach them the readiest way to another man&rsquo;s apprehension,
and open their meaning fully, roundly, and distinctly, so as the reader
may not think a second view cast away upon your letter.&nbsp; And though
respect be a part following this, yet now here, and still I must remember
it, if you write to a man, whose estate and sense, as senses, you are
familiar with, you may the bolder (to set a task to his brain) venture
on a knot.&nbsp; But if to your superior, you are bound to measure him
in three farther points: first, with interest in him; secondly, his
capacity in your letters; thirdly, his leisure to peruse them.&nbsp;
For your interest or favour with him, you are to be the shorter or longer,
more familiar or submiss, as he will afford you time.&nbsp; For his
capacity, you are to be quicker and fuller of those reaches and glances
of wit or learning, as he is able to entertain them.&nbsp; For his leisure,
you are commanded to the greater briefness, as his place is of greater
discharges and cares.&nbsp; But with your betters, you are not to put
riddles of wit, by being too scarce of words; not to cause the trouble
of making breviates by writing too riotous and wastingly.&nbsp; Brevity
is attained in matter by avoiding idle compliments, prefaces, protestations,
parentheses, superfluous circuit of figures and digressions: in the
composition, by omitting conjunctions [<i>not only</i>,<i> but also;
both the one and the other</i>,<i> whereby it cometh to pass</i>] and
such like idle particles, that have no great business in a serious letter
but breaking of sentences, as oftentimes a short journey is made long
by unnessary baits.<br>
<br>
<i>Quintilian.</i> - But, as Quintilian saith, there is a briefness
of the parts sometimes that makes the whole long: &ldquo;As I came to
the stairs, I took a pair of oars, they launched out, rowed apace, I
landed at the court gate, I paid my fare, went up to the presence, asked
for my lord, I was admitted.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this is but, &ldquo;I
went to the court and spake with my lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the fault
of some Latin writers within these last hundred years of my reading,
and perhaps Seneca may be appeached of it; I accuse him not.<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp; <i>Perspicuitas.</i> - The next property of epistolary style
is perspicuity, and is oftentimes by affectation of some wit ill angled
for, or ostentation of some hidden terms of art.&nbsp; Few words they
darken speech, and so do too many; as well too much light hurteth the
eyes, as too little; and a long bill of chancery confounds the understanding
as much as the shortest note; therefore, let not your letters be penned
like English statutes, and this is obtained.&nbsp; These vices are eschewed
by pondering your business well and distinctly concerning yourself,
which is much furthered by uttering your thoughts, and letting them
as well come forth to the light and judgment of your own outward senses
as to the censure of other men&rsquo;s ears; for that is the reason
why many good scholars speak but fumblingly; like a rich man, that for
want of particular note and difference can bring you no certain ware
readily out of his shop.&nbsp; Hence it is that talkative shallow men
do often content the hearers more than the wise.&nbsp; But this may
find a speedier redress in writing, where all comes under the last examination
of the eyes.&nbsp; First, mind it well, then pen it, then examine it,
then amend it, and you may be in the better hope of doing reasonably
well.&nbsp; Under this virtue may come plainness, which is not to be
curious in the order as to answer a letter, as if you were to answer
to interrogatories.&nbsp; As to the first, first; and to the second,
secondly, &amp;c. but both in method to use (as ladies do in their attire)
a diligent kind of negligence, and their sportive freedom; though with
some men you are not to jest, or practise tricks; yet the delivery of
the most important things may be carried with such a grace, as that
it may yield a pleasure to the conceit of the reader.&nbsp; There must
be store, though no excess of terms; as if you are to name store, sometimes
you may call it choice, sometimes plenty, sometimes copiousness, or
variety; but ever so, that the word which comes in lieu have not such
difference of meaning as that it may put the sense of the first in hazard
to be mistaken.&nbsp; You are not to cast a ring for the perfumed terms
of the time, as <i>accommodation</i>,<i> complement</i>,<i> spirit </i>&amp;c.,
but use them properly in their place, as others.<br>
<br>
3.&nbsp; <i>Vigor</i> - There followeth life and quickness, which is
the strength and sinews, as it were, of your penning by pretty sayings,
similitudes, and conceits; allusions from known history, or other common-place,
such as are in the <i>Courtier</i>,<i> </i>and the second book of Cicero
<i>De Oratore.<br>
<br>
</i>4.&nbsp; <i>Discretio</i>. - The last is, respect to discern what
fits yourself, him to whom you write, and that which you handle, which
is a quality fit to conclude the rest, because it doth include all.&nbsp;
And that must proceed from ripeness of judgment, which, as one truly
saith, is gotten by four means, God, nature, diligence, and conversation.&nbsp;
Serve the first well, and the rest will serve you.<br>
<br>
<i>De Poetica</i>. - We have spoken sufficiently of oratory, let us
now make a diversion to poetry.&nbsp; Poetry, in the primogeniture,
had many peccant humours, and is made to have more now, through the
levity and inconstancy of men&rsquo;s judgments.&nbsp; Whereas, indeed,
it is the most prevailing eloquence, and of the most exalted caract.&nbsp;
Now the discredits and disgraces are many it hath received through men&rsquo;s
study of depravation or calumny; their practice being to give it diminution
of credit, by lessening the professor&rsquo;s estimation, and making
the age afraid of their liberty; and the age is grown so tender of her
fame, as she calls all writings aspersions.<br>
<br>
That is the state word, the phrase of court (placentia college), which
some call Parasites place, the Inn of Ignorance.<br>
<br>
<i>D. Hieronymus. </i>- Whilst I name no persons, but deride follies,
why should any man confess or betray himself why doth not that of S.
Hierome come into their mind, <i>Ubi generalis est de vitiis disputatio</i>,<i>
ibi nullius esse person&aelig; injuriam</i>? <a name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a">{133a}</a>&nbsp;
Is it such an inexpiable crime in poets to tax vices generally, and
no offence in them, who, by their exception confess they have committed
them particularly?&nbsp; Are we fallen into those times that we must
not -<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Auriculas teneras mordaci rodere vero.&rdquo; <a name="citation133b"></a><a href="#footnote133b">{133b}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Remedii votum semper verius erat</i>,<i> quam spes. </i><a name="citation133c"></a><a href="#footnote133c">{133c}</a>
<i>- Sexus f&aelig;min</i>. - If men may by no means write freely, or
speak truth, but when it offends not, why do physicians cure with sharp
medicines, or corrosives? is not the same equally lawful in the cure
of the mind that is in the cure of the body?&nbsp; Some vices, you will
say, are so foul that it is better they should be done than spoken.&nbsp;
But they that take offence where no name, character, or signature doth
blazon them seem to me like affected as women, who if they hear anything
ill spoken of the ill of their sex, are presently moved, as if the contumely
respected their particular; and on the contrary, when they hear good
of good women, conclude that it belongs to them all.&nbsp; If I see
anything that toucheth me, shall I come forth a betrayer of myself presently?&nbsp;
No, if I be wise, I&rsquo;ll dissemble it; if honest, I&rsquo;ll avoid
it, lest I publish that on my own forehead which I saw there noted without
a title.&nbsp; A man that is on the mending hand will either ingenuously
confess or wisely dissemble his disease.&nbsp; And the wise and virtuous
will never think anything belongs to themselves that is written, but
rejoice that the good are warned not to be such; and the ill to leave
to be such.&nbsp; The person offended hath no reason to be offended
with the writer, but with himself; and so to declare that properly to
belong to him which was so spoken of all men, as it could be no man&rsquo;s
several, but his that would wilfully and desperately claim it.&nbsp;
It sufficeth I know what kind of persons I displease, men bred in the
declining and decay of virtue, betrothed to their own vices; that have
abandoned or prostituted their good names; hungry and ambitious of infamy,
invested in all deformity, enthralled to ignorance and malice, of a
hidden and concealed malignity, and that hold a concomitancy with all
evil.<br>

<br>
<i>What is a Poet?<br>
<br>
<br>
Poeta. </i>- A poet is that which by the Greeks is called &kappa;&alpha;&tau;
&epsilon;&xi;&omicron;&chi;&eta;&nu;, &omicron; &pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;,
a maker, or a feigner: his art, an art of imitation or feigning; expressing
the life of man in fit measure, numbers, and harmony, according to Aristotle;
from the word &pi;&omicron;&iota;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;, which signifies
to make or feign.&nbsp; Hence he is called a poet, not he which writeth
in measure only, but that feigneth and formeth a fable, and writes things
like the truth.&nbsp; For the fable and fiction is, as it were, the
form and soul of any poetical work or poem.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>What mean</i>,<i> you by a Poem?<br>
<br>
<br>
Poema</i>. - A poem is not alone any work or composition of the poet&rsquo;s
in many or few verses; but even one verse alone sometimes makes a perfect
poem.&nbsp; As when &AElig;neas hangs up and consecrates the arms of
Abas with this inscription:-<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&AElig;neas h&aelig;c de Danais victoribus arma.&rdquo; <a name="citation136a"></a><a href="#footnote136a">{136a}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
And calls it a poem or carmen.&nbsp; Such are those in Martial:-<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Omnia, Castor, emis: sic fiet, ut omnia vendas.&rdquo; <a name="citation136b"></a><a href="#footnote136b">{136b}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
And -<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Pauper videri Cinna vult, et est pauper.&rdquo; <a name="citation136c"></a><a href="#footnote136c">{136c}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Horatius. - Lucretius</i>. - So were Horace&rsquo;s odes called Carmina,
his lyric songs.&nbsp; And Lucretius designs a whole book in his sixth:-<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Quod in primo quoque carmine claret.&rdquo; <a name="citation136d"></a><a href="#footnote136d">{136d}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Epicum. -</i> <i>Dramaticum. -</i> <i>Lyricum. -</i> <i>Elegiacum.
- Epigrammat</i>. - And anciently all the oracles were called Carmina;
or whatever sentence was expressed, were it much or little, it was called
an Epic, Dramatic, Lyric, Elegiac, or Epigrammatic poem.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>But how differs a Poem from what we call Poesy?<br>
<br>
<br>
Poesis. - Artium regina. - Poet. differenti&aelig;. - Grammatic. -</i>
<i>Logic. -</i> <i>Rhetoric. -</i> <i>Ethica. -</i> A poem, as I have
told you, is the work of the poet; the end and fruit of his labour and
study.&nbsp; Poesy is his skill or craft of making; the very fiction
itself, the reason or form of the work.&nbsp; And these three voices
differ, as the thing done, the doing, and the doer; the thing feigned,
the feigning, and the feigner; so the poem, the poesy, and the poet.&nbsp;
Now the poesy is the habit or the art; nay, rather the queen of arts,
which had her original from heaven, received thence from the Hebrews,
and had in prime estimation with the Greeks transmitted to the Latins
and all nations that professed civility.&nbsp; The study of it (if we
will trust Aristotle) offers to mankind a certain rule and pattern of
living well and happily, disposing us to all civil offices of society.&nbsp;
If we will believe Tully, it nourisheth and instructeth our youth, delights
our age, adorns our prosperity, comforts our adversity, entertains us
at home, keeps us company abroad, travels with us, watches, divides
the times of our earnest and sports, shares in our country recesses
and recreations; insomuch as the wisest and best learned have thought
her the absolute mistress of manners and nearest of kin to virtue.&nbsp;
And whereas they entitle philosophy to be a rigid and austere poesy,
they have, on the contrary, styled poesy a dulcet and gentle philosophy,
which leads on and guides us by the hand to action with a ravishing
delight and incredible sweetness.&nbsp; But before we handle the kinds
of poems, with their special differences, or make court to the art itself,
as a mistress, I would lead you to the knowledge of our poet by a perfect
information what he is or should be by nature, by exercise, by imitation,
by study, and so bring him down through the disciplines of grammar,
logic, rhetoric, and the ethics, adding somewhat out of all, peculiar
to himself, and worthy of your admittance or reception.<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; <i>Ingenium. -</i> <i>Seneca. -</i> <i>Plato. -</i> <i>Aristotle.
-</i> <i>Helicon. -</i> <i>Pegasus. -</i> <i>Parnassus. -</i> <i>Ovid.
-</i> First, we require in our poet or maker (for that title our language
affords him elegantly with the Greek) a goodness of natural wit.&nbsp;
For whereas all other arts consist of doctrine and precepts, the poet
must be able by nature and instinct to pour out the treasure of his
mind, and as Seneca saith, <i>Aliquando secundum Anacreontem insanire
jucundum esse; </i>by which he understands the poetical rapture.&nbsp;
And according to that of Plato, <i>Frustr&agrave; poeticas fores sui
compos pulsavit</i>.&nbsp; And of Aristotle, <i>Nullum magnum ingenium
sine mixtur&acirc; dementi&aelig; fuit.&nbsp; Nec potest grande aliquid</i>,<i>
et supra c&aelig;teros loqui</i>,<i> nisi mota mens</i>.&nbsp; Then
it riseth higher, as by a divine instinct, when it contemns common and
known conceptions.&nbsp; It utters somewhat above a mortal mouth.&nbsp;
Then it gets aloft and flies away with his rider, whither before it
was doubtful to ascend.&nbsp; This the poets understood by their Helicon,
Pegasus, or Parnassus; and this made Ovid to boast,<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Est deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo<br>
Sedibus &aelig;thereis spiritus ille venit.&rdquo; <a name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a">{139a}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lipsius. - Petron. in. Fragm</i>. - And Lipsius to affirm, <i>Scio</i>,<i>
poetam neminem pr&aelig;stantem fuisse</i>,<i> sine parte quadam uberiore
divin&aelig; aur&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; And hence it is that the coming up
of good poets (for I mind not mediocres or imos) is so thin and rare
among us.&nbsp; Every beggarly corporation affords the State a mayor
or two bailiffs yearly; but <i>Solus rex</i>,<i> aut poeta</i>,<i> non
quotannis nascitur</i>.&nbsp; To this perfection of nature in our poet
we require exercise of those parts, and frequent.<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp; <i>Exercitatio. -</i> <i>Virgil. -</i> <i>Scaliger. -</i> <i>Valer.
Maximus. - Euripides. - Alcestis</i>. - If his wit will not arrive suddenly
at the dignity of the ancients, let him not yet fall out with it, quarrel,
or be over hastily angry; offer to turn it away from study in a humour,
but come to it again upon better cogitation; try another time with labour.&nbsp;
If then it succeed not, cast not away the quills yet, nor scratch the
wainscot, beat not the poor desk, but bring all to the forge and file
again; torn it anew.&nbsp; There is no statute law of the kingdom bids
you be a poet against your will or the first quarter; if it comes in
a year or two, it is well.&nbsp; The common rhymers pour forth verses,
such as they are, <i>ex tempore; </i>but there never comes from them
one sense worth the life of a day.&nbsp; A rhymer and a poet are two
things.&nbsp; It is said of the incomparable Virgil that he brought
forth his verses like a bear, and after formed them with licking.&nbsp;
Scaliger the father writes it of him, that he made a quantity of verses
in the morning, which afore night he reduced to a less number.&nbsp;
But that which Valerius Maximus hath left recorded of Euripides, the
tragic poet, his answer to Alcestis, another poet, is as memorable as
modest; who, when it was told to Alcestis that Euripides had in three
days brought forth but three verses, and those with some difficulty
and throes, Alcestis, glorying he could with ease have sent forth a
hundred in the space, Euripides roundly replied, &ldquo;Like enough;
but here is the difference: thy verses will not last these three days,
mine will to all time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which was as much as to tell him
he could not write a verse.&nbsp; I have met many of these rattles that
made a noise and buzzed.&nbsp; They had their hum, and no more.&nbsp;
Indeed, things wrote with labour deserve to be so read, and will last
their age.<br>
<br>
3.&nbsp; <i>Imitatio. -</i> <i>Horatius. -</i> <i>Virgil. -</i> <i>Statius.
-</i> <i>Homer. - Horat. - Archil. - Alc&aelig;us</i>,<i> </i>&amp;c.
- The third requisite in our poet or maker is imitation, to be able
to convert the substance or riches of another poet to his own use.&nbsp;
To make choice of one excellent man above the rest, and so to follow
him till he grow very he, or so like him as the copy may be mistaken
for the principal.&nbsp; Not as a creature that swallows what it takes
in crude, raw, or undigested, but that feeds with an appetite, and hath
a stomach to concoct, divide, and turn all into nourishment.&nbsp; Not
to imitate servilely, as Horace saith, and catch at vices for virtue,
but to draw forth out of the best and choicest flowers, with the bee,
and turn all into honey, work it into one relish and savour; make our
imitation sweet; observe how the best writers have imitated, and follow
them.&nbsp; How Virgil and Statius have imitated Homer; how Horace,
Archilochus; how Alc&aelig;us, and the other lyrics; and so of the rest.<br>
<br>
4.&nbsp; <i>Lectio. -</i> <i>Parnassus. -</i> <i>Helicon. - Arscoron.
- M. T. Cicero. - Simylus. - Stob. - Horat. - Aristot</i>. - But that
which we especially require in him is an exactness of study and multiplicity
of reading, which maketh a full man, not alone enabling him to know
the history or argument of a poem and to report it, but so to master
the matter and style, as to show he knows how to handle, place, or dispose
of either with elegancy when need shall be.&nbsp; And not think he can
leap forth suddenly a poet by dreaming he hath been in Parnassus, or
having washed his lips, as they say, in Helicon.&nbsp; There goes more
to his making than so; for to nature, exercise, imitation, and study
art must be added to make all these perfect.&nbsp; And though these
challenge to themselves much in the making up of our maker, it is Art
only can lead him to perfection, and leave him there in possession,
as planted by her hand.&nbsp; It is the assertion of Tully, if to an
excellent nature there happen an accession or conformation of learning
and discipline, there will then remain somewhat noble and singular.&nbsp;
For, as Simylus saith in Stob&aelig;us, &Omicron&upsilon;&tau;&epsilon;
&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; &iota;&kappa;&alpha;&nu;&eta; y&iota;&nu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;
&tau;&epsilon;&chi;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf; &alpha;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;, &omicron;&upsilon;&tau;&epsilon;
&pi;&alpha;&nu; &tau;&epsilon;&chi;&nu;&eta; &mu;&eta; &phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&nu;
&kappa;&epsilon;&kappa;&tau;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&eta;, without art
nature can never be perfect; and without nature art can claim no being.&nbsp;
But our poet must beware that his study be not only to learn of himself;
for he that shall affect to do that confesseth his ever having a fool
to his master.&nbsp; He must read many, but ever the best and choicest;
those that can teach him anything he must ever account his masters,
and reverence.&nbsp; Among whom Horace and (he that taught him) Aristotle
deserved to be the first in estimation.&nbsp; Aristotle was the first
accurate critic and truest judge - nay, the greatest philosopher the
world ever had - for he noted the vices of all knowledges in all creatures,
and out of many men&rsquo;s perfections in a science he formed still
one art.&nbsp; So he taught us two offices together, how we ought to
judge rightly of others, and what we ought to imitate specially in ourselves.&nbsp;
But all this in vain without a natural wit and a poetical nature in
chief.&nbsp; For no man, so soon as he knows this or reads it, shall
be able to write the better; but as he is adapted to it by nature, he
shall grow the perfecter writer.&nbsp; He must have civil prudence and
eloquence, and that whole; not taken up by snatches or pieces in sentences
or remnants when he will handle business or carry counsels, as if he
came then out of the declaimer&rsquo;s gallery, or shadow furnished
but out of the body of the State, which commonly is the school of men.<br>
<br>
<i>Virorum schola respub. - Lysippus. - Apelles. - N&aelig;vius</i>.
- The poet is the nearest borderer upon the orator, and expresseth all
his virtues, though he be tied more to numbers, is his equal in ornament,
and above him in his strengths.&nbsp; And (of the kind) the comic comes
nearest; because in moving the minds of men, and stirring of affections
(in which oratory shows, and especially approves her eminence), he chiefly
excels.&nbsp; What figure of a body was Lysippus ever able to form with
his graver, or Apelles to paint with his pencil, as the comedy to life
expresseth so many and various affections of the mind?&nbsp; There shall
the spectator see some insulting with joy, others fretting with melancholy,
raging with anger, mad with love, boiling with avarice, undone with
riot, tortured with expectation, consumed with fear; no perturbation
in common life but the orator finds an example of it in the scene.&nbsp;
And then for the elegancy of language, read but this inscription on
the grave of a comic poet:<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Immortales mortales si fas esset fiere,<br>
Flerent div&aelig; Cam&oelig;n&aelig; N&aelig;vium poetam;<br>
Itaque postquam est Orcino traditus thesauro,<br>
Obliti sunt Rom&aelig; lingu&acirc; loqui Latin&acirc;.&rdquo; <a name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a">{146a}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>L. &AElig;lius Stilo. - Plautus. - M. Varro</i>. - Or that modester
testimony given by Lucius &AElig;lius Stilo upon Plautus, who affirmed,
<i>&ldquo;Musas</i>,<i> si Latin&egrave; loqui voluissent</i>,<i> Plautino
sermone fuisse loquuturas</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that illustrious judgment
by the most learned M. Varro of him, who pronounced him the prince of
letters and elegancy in the Roman language.<br>
<br>
<i>Sophocles</i>. - I am not of that opinion to conclude a poet&rsquo;s
liberty within the narrow limits of laws which either the grammarians
or philosophers prescribe.&nbsp; For before they found out those laws
there were many excellent poets that fulfilled them, amongst whom none
more perfect than Sophocles, who lived a little before Aristotle.<br>
<br>
<i>Demosthenes. -</i> <i>Pericles. -</i> <i>Alcibiades. -</i> Which
of the Greeklings durst ever give precepts to Demosthenes? or to Pericles,
whom the age surnamed Heavenly, because he seemed to thunder and lighten
with his language? or to Alcibiades, who had rather Nature for his guide
than Art for his master?<br>
<br>
<i>Aristotle</i>. - But whatsoever nature at any time dictated to the
most happy, or long exercise to the most laborious, that the wisdom
and learning of Aristotle hath brought into an art, because he understood
the causes of things; and what other men did by chance or custom he
doth by reason; and not only found out the way not to err, but the short
way we should take not to err.<br>
<br>
<i>Euripides. -</i> <i>Aristophanes. -</i> Many things in Euripides
hath Aristophanes wittily reprehended, not out of art, but out of truth.&nbsp;
For Euripides is sometimes peccant, as he is most times perfect.&nbsp;
But judgment when it is greatest, if reason doth not accompany it, is
not ever absolute.<br>
<br>
<i>Cens. Scal. in Lil. Germ. - Horace</i>. - To judge of poets is only
the faculty of poets; and not of all poets, but the best.&nbsp; <i>Nemo
infelici&ugrave;s de poetis judicavit</i>,<i> qu&agrave;m qui de poetis
scripsit</i>. <a name="citation148a"></a><a href="#footnote148a">{148a}</a>&nbsp;
But some will say critics are a kind of tinkers, that make more faults
than they mend ordinarily.&nbsp; See their diseases and those of grammarians.&nbsp;
It is true, many bodies are the worse for the meddling with; and the
multitude of physicians hath destroyed many sound patients with their
wrong practice.&nbsp; But the office of a true critic or censor is,
not to throw by a letter anywhere, or damn an innocent syllable, but
lay the words together, and amend them; judge sincerely of the author
and his matter, which is the sign of solid and perfect learning in a
man.&nbsp; Such was Horace, an author of much civility, and (if<i> </i>any
one among the heathen can be) the best master both of virtue and wisdom;
an excellent and true judge upon cause and reason, not because he thought
so, but because he knew so out of use and experience.<br>
<br>
Cato, the grammarian, a defender of Lucilius. <a name="citation149a"></a><a href="#footnote149a">{149a}</a><br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Cato grammaticus, Latina syren,<br>
Qui solus legit, et facit poetas.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Quintilian of the same heresy, but rejected. <a name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b">{149b}</a><br>
<br>
Horace, his judgment of Ch&oelig;rillus defended against Joseph Scaliger.
<a name="citation149c"></a><a href="#footnote149c">{149c}</a>&nbsp;
And of Laberius against Julius. <a name="citation149d"></a><a href="#footnote149d">{149d}</a><br>
<br>
But chiefly his opinion of Plautus <a name="citation149e"></a><a href="#footnote149e">{149e}</a>
vindicated against many that are offended, and say it is a hard censure
upon the parent of all conceit and sharpness.&nbsp; And they wish it
had not fallen from so great a master and censor in the art, whose bondmen
knew better how to judge of Plautus than any that dare patronise the
family of learning in this age; who could not be ignorant of the judgment
of the times in which he lived, when poetry and the Latin language were
at the height; especially being a man so conversant and inwardly familiar
with the censures of great men that did discourse of these things daily
amongst themselves.&nbsp; Again, a man so gracious and in high favour
with the Emperor, as Augustus often called him his witty manling (for
the littleness of his stature), and, if we may trust antiquity, had
designed him for a secretary of estate, and invited him to the palace,
which he modestly prayed off and refused.<br>
<br>
<i>Terence. - Menander</i>.&nbsp; Horace did so highly esteem Terence&rsquo;s
comedies, as he ascribes the art in comedy to him alone among the Latins,
and joins him with Menander.<br>
<br>
Now, let us see what may be said for either, to defend Horace&rsquo;s
judgment to posterity and not wholly to condemn Plautus.<br>
<br>
<i>The parts of a comedy and tragedy</i>. - The parts of a comedy are
the same with a tragedy, and the end is partly the same, for they both
delight and teach; the comics are called &delta;&iota;&delta;&alpha;&sigma;&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;,<i>
</i>of the Greeks no less than the tragics.<br>
<br>
<i>Aristotle. - Plato. - Homer. - </i>Nor is the moving of laughter
always the end of comedy; that is rather a fowling for the people&rsquo;s
delight, or their fooling.&nbsp; For, as Aristotle says rightly, the
moving of laughter is a fault in comedy, a kind of turpitude that depraves
some part of a man&rsquo;s nature without a disease.&nbsp; As a wry
face without pain moves laughter, or a deformed vizard, or a rude clown
dressed in a lady&rsquo;s habit and using her actions; we dislike and
scorn such representations which made the ancient philosophers ever
think laughter unfitting in a wise man.&nbsp; And this induced Plato
to esteem of Homer as a sacrilegious person, because he presented the
gods sometimes laughing.&nbsp; As also it is divinely said of Aristotle,
that to seen ridiculous is a part of dishonesty, and foolish.<br>
<br>
<i>The wit of the old comedy. </i>- So that what either in the words
or sense of an author, or in the language or actions of men, is awry
or depraved does strangely stir mean affections, and provoke for the
most part to laughter.&nbsp; And therefore it was clear that all insolent
and obscene speeches, jests upon the best men, injuries to particular
persons, perverse and sinister sayings (and the rather unexpected) in
the old comedy did move laughter, especially where it did imitate any
dishonesty, and scurrility came forth in the place of wit, which, who
understands the nature and genius of laughter cannot but perfectly know.<br>
<br>
<i>Aristophanes. - Plautus</i>. - Of which Aristophanes affords an ample
harvest, having not only outgone Plautus or any other in that kind,
but expressed all the moods and figures of what is ridiculous oddly.&nbsp;
In short, as vinegar is not accounted good until the wine be corrupted,
so jests that are true and natural seldom raise laughter with the beast
the multitude.&nbsp; They love nothing that is right and proper.&nbsp;
The farther it runs from reason or possibility with them the better
it is.<br>
<br>
<i>Socrates. -</i> <i>Theatrical wit. -</i> What could have made them
laugh, like to see Socrates presented, that example of all good life,
honesty, and virtue, to have him hoisted up with a pulley, and there
play the philosopher in a basket; measure how many foot a flea could
skip geometrically, by a just scale, and edify the people from the engine.&nbsp;
This was theatrical wit, right stage jesting, and relishing a playhouse,
invented for scorn and laughter; whereas, if it had savoured of equity,
truth, perspicuity, and candour, to have tasten a wise or a learned
palate, - spit it out presently! this is bitter and profitable: this
instructs and would inform us: what need we know any thing, that are
nobly born, more than a horse-race, or a hunting-match, our day to break
with citizens, and such innate mysteries?<br>
<br>
<i>The cart</i>. - This is truly leaping from the stage to the tumbril
again, reducing all wit to the original dung-cart.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Of the magnitude and compass of any fable</i>,<i> epic or</i> <i>dramatic.<br>
<br>
What the measure of a fable is. - The fable or plot of a poem defined.
- The epic fable</i>,<i> differing from the dramatic</i>. - To the resolving
of this question we must first agree in the definition of the fable.&nbsp;
The fable is called the imitation of one entire and perfect action,
whose parts are so joined and knit together, as nothing in the structure
can be changed, or taken away, without impairing or troubling the whole,
of which there is a proportionable magnitude in the members.&nbsp; As
for example: if a man would build a house, he would first appoint a
place to build it in, which he would define within certain bounds; so
in the constitution of a poem, the action is aimed at by the poet, which
answers place in a building, and that action hath his largeness, compass,
and proportion.&nbsp; But as a court or king&rsquo;s palace requires
other dimensions than a private house, so the epic asks a magnitude
from other poems, since what is place in the one is action in the other;
the difference is an space.&nbsp; So that by this definition we conclude
the fable to be the imitation of one perfect and entire action, as one
perfect and entire place is required to a building.&nbsp; By perfect,
we understand that to which nothing is wanting, as place to the building
that is raised, and action to the fable that is formed.&nbsp; It is
perfect, perhaps not for a court or king&rsquo;s palace, which requires
a greater ground, but for the structure he would raise; so the space
of the action may not prove large enough for the epic fable, yet be
perfect for the dramatic, and whole.<br>
<br>
<i>What we understand by whole</i>. - Whole we call that, and perfect,
which hath a beginning, a midst, and an end.&nbsp; So the place of any
building may be whole and entire for that work, though too little for
a palace.&nbsp; As to a tragedy or a comedy, the action may be convenient
and perfect that would not fit an epic poem in magnitude.&nbsp; So a
lion is a perfect creature in himself, though it be less than that of
a buffalo or a rhinocerote.&nbsp; They differ but in specie: either
in the kind is absolute; both have their parts, and either the whole.&nbsp;
Therefore, as in every body so in every action, which is the subject
of a just work, there is required a certain proportionable greatness,
neither too vast nor too minute.&nbsp; For that which happens to the
eyes when we behold a body, the same happens to the memory when we contemplate
an action.&nbsp; I look upon a monstrous giant, as Tityus, whose body
covered nine acres of land, and mine eye sticks upon every part; the
whole that consists of those parts will never be taken in at one entire
view.&nbsp; So in a fable, if the action be too great, we can never
comprehend the whole together in our imagination.&nbsp; Again, if it
be too little, there ariseth no pleasure out of the object; it affords
the view no stay; it is beheld, and vanisheth at once.&nbsp; As if we
should look upon an ant or pismire, the parts fly the sight, and the
whole considered is almost nothing.&nbsp; The same happens in action,
which is the object of memory, as the body is of sight.&nbsp; Too vast
oppresseth the eyes, and exceeds the memory; too little scarce admits
either.<br>
<br>
<i>What is the utmost bounds of a fable</i>. - Now in every action it
behoves the poet to know which is his utmost bound, how far with fitness
and a necessary proportion he may produce and determine it; that is,
till either good fortune change into the worse, or the worse into the
better.&nbsp; For as a body without proportion cannot be goodly, no
more can the action, either in comedy or tragedy, without his fit bounds:
and every bound, for the nature of the subject, is esteemed the best
that is largest, till it can increase no more; so it behoves the action
in tragedy or comedy to be let grow till the necessity ask a conclusion;
wherein two things are to be considered: first, that it exceed not the
compass of one day; next, that there be place left for digression and
art.&nbsp; For the episodes and digressions in a fable are the same
that household stuff and other furniture are in a house.&nbsp; And so
far from the measure and extent of a fable dramatic.<br>
<br>
<i>What by one and entire</i>. - Now that it should be one and entire.&nbsp;
One is considerable two ways; either as it is only separate, and by
itself, or as being composed of many parts, it begins to be one as those
parts grow or are wrought together.&nbsp; That it should be one the
first away alone, and by itself, no man that hath tasted letters ever
would say, especially having required before a just magnitude and equal
proportion of the parts in themselves.&nbsp; Neither of which can possibly
be, if the action be single and separate, not composed of parts, which
laid together in themselves, with an equal and fitting proportion, tend
to the same end; which thing out of antiquity itself hath deceived many,
and more this day it doth deceive.<br>
<br>
<i>Hercules. -</i> <i>Theseus. -</i> <i>Achilles. -</i> <i>Ulysses.
-</i> <i>Homer and Virgil. - &AElig;neas. - Venus. -</i> So many there
be of old that have thought the action of one man to be one, as of Hercules,
Theseus, Achilles, Ulysses, and other heroes; which is both foolish
and false, since by one and the same person many things may be severally
done which cannot fitly be referred or joined to the same end: which
not only the excellent tragic poets, but the best masters of the epic,
Homer and Virgil, saw.&nbsp; For though the argument of an epic poem
be far more diffused and poured out than that of tragedy, yet Virgil,
writing of &AElig;neas, hath pretermitted many things.&nbsp; He neither
tells how he was born, how brought up, how he fought with Achilles,
how he was snatched out of the battle by Venus; but that one thing,
how he came into Italy, he prosecutes in twelve books.&nbsp; The rest
of his journey, his error by sea, the sack of Troy, are put not as the
argument of the work, but episodes of the argument.&nbsp; So Homer laid
by many things of Ulysses, and handled no more than he saw tended to
one and the same end.<br>
<br>
<i>Theseus. -</i> <i>Hercules. -</i> <i>Juvenal. - Codrus. -</i> <i>Sophocles.
- Ajax. - Ulysses</i>. - Contrary to which, and foolishly, those poets
did, whom the philosopher taxeth, of whom one gathered all the actions
of Theseus, another put all the labours of Hercules in one work.&nbsp;
So did he whom Juvenal mentions in the beginning, &ldquo;hoarse Codrus,&rdquo;
that recited a volume compiled, which he called his Theseide, not yet
finished, to the great trouble both of his hearers and himself; amongst
which there were many parts had no coherence nor kindred one with another,
so far they were from being one action, one fable.&nbsp; For as a house,
consisting of divers materials, becomes one structure and one dwelling,
so an action, composed of divers parts, may become one fable, epic or
dramatic.&nbsp; For example, in a tragedy, look upon Sophocles, his
Ajax: Ajax, deprived of Achilles&rsquo; armour, which he hoped from
the suffrage of the Greeks, disdains; and, growing impatient of the
injury, rageth, and runs mad.&nbsp; In that humour he doth many senseless
things, and at last falls upon the Grecian flock and kills a great ram
for Ulysses: returning to his senses, he grows ashamed of the scorn,
and kills himself; and is by the chiefs of the Greeks forbidden burial.&nbsp;
These things agree and hang together, not as they were done, but as
seeming to be done, which made the action whole, entire, and absolute.<br>
<br>
<i>The conclusion concerning the whole</i>,<i> and the parts. - Which
are episodes. - Ajax and Hector. - Homer</i>. - For the whole, as it
consisteth of parts, so without all the parts it is not the whole; and
to make it absolute is required not only the parts, but such parts as
are true.&nbsp; For a part of the whole was true; which, if you take
away, you either change the whole or it is not the whole.&nbsp; For
if it be such a part, as, being present or absent, nothing concerns
the whole, it cannot be called a part of the whole; and such are the
episodes, of which hereafter.&nbsp; For the present here is one example:
the single combat of Ajax with Hector, as it is at large described in
Homer, nothing belongs to this Ajax of Sophocles.<br>
<br>
You admire no poems but such as run like a brewer&rsquo;s cart upon
the stones, hobbling:-<br>

SOME POEMS.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TO WILLIAM CAMDEN<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Camden! most reverend head, to whom I owe<br>
All that I am in arts, all that I know -<br>
How nothing&rsquo;s that! to whom my country owes<br>
The great renown, and name wherewith she goes!<br>
Than thee the age sees not that thing more grave,<br>
More high, more holy, that she more would crave.<br>
What name, what skill, what faith hast thou in things!<br>
What sight in searching the most antique springs!<br>
What weight, and what authority in thy speech!<br>
Men scarce can make that doubt, but thou canst teach.<br>
Pardon free truth, and let thy modesty,<br>
Which conquers all, be once o&rsquo;ercome by thee.<br>
Many of thine, this better could, than I;<br>
But for their powers, accept my piety.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ON MY FIRST DAUGHTER<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here lies, to each her parents&rsquo; ruth,<br>
Mary, the daughter of their youth;<br>
Yet, all heaven&rsquo;s gifts, being heaven&rsquo;s due,<br>
It makes the father less to rue.<br>
At six months&rsquo; end, she parted hence,<br>
With safety of her innocence;<br>
Whose soul heaven&rsquo;s queen, whose name she bears,<br>
In comfort of her mother&rsquo;s tears,<br>
Hath placed amongst her virgin-train;<br>
Where, while that severed doth remain,<br>
This grave partakes the fleshly birth;<br>
Which cover lightly, gentle earth!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ON MY FIRST SON<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;<br>
My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy;<br>
Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,<br>
Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.<br>
Oh! could I lose all father, now! for why,<br>
Will man lament the state he should envy?<br>
To have so soon &rsquo;scaped world&rsquo;s, and flesh&rsquo;s rage,<br>
And, if no other misery, yet age!<br>
Rest in soft peace, and, asked, say here doth lie<br>
Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry;<br>
For whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such,<br>
As what he loves may never like too much.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TO FRANCIS BEAUMONT<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How I do love thee, Beaumont, and thy muse,<br>
That unto me dost such religion use!<br>
How I do fear myself, that am not worth<br>
The least indulgent thought thy pen drops forth!<br>
At once thou mak&rsquo;st me happy, and unmak&rsquo;st;<br>
And giving largely to me, more thou takest!<br>
What fate is mine, that so itself bereaves?<br>
What art is thine, that so thy friend deceives?<br>
When even there, where most thou praisest me,<br>
For writing better, I must envy thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OF LIFE AND DEATH<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The ports of death are sins; of life, good deeds:<br>
Through which our merit leads us to our meeds.<br>
How wilful blind is he, then, that would stray,<br>
And hath it in his powers to make his way!<br>
This world death&rsquo;s region is, the other life&rsquo;s:<br>
And here it should be one of our first strifes,<br>
So to front death, as men might judge us past it:<br>
For good men but see death, the wicked taste it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INVITING A FRIEND TO SUPPER<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To-night, grave sir, both my poor house and I<br>
Do equally desire your company;<br>
Not that we think us worthy such a guest,<br>
But that your worth will dignify our feast,<br>
With those that come; whose grace may make that seem<br>
Something, which else could hope for no esteem.<br>
It is the fair acceptance, sir, creates<br>
The entertainment perfect, not the cates.<br>
Yet shall you have, to rectify your palate,<br>
An olive, capers, or some bitter salad<br>
Ushering the mutton; with a short-legged hen,<br>
If we can get her, full of eggs, and then,<br>
Lemons and wine for sauce: to these, a coney<br>
Is not to be despaired of for our money;<br>
And though fowl now be scarce, yet there are clerks,<br>
The sky not falling, think we may have larks.<br>
I&rsquo;ll tell you of more, and lie, so you will come:<br>
Of partridge, pheasant, woodcock, of which some<br>
May yet be there; and godwit if we can;<br>
Knat, rail, and ruff, too.&nbsp; Howsoe&rsquo;er, my man<br>
Shall read a piece of Virgil, Tacitus,<br>
Livy, or of some better book to us,<br>
Of which we&rsquo;ll speak our minds, amidst our meat;<br>
And I&rsquo;ll profess no verses to repeat:<br>
To this if aught appear, which I not know of,<br>
That will the pastry, not my paper, show of.<br>
Digestive cheese, and fruit there sure will be;<br>
But that which most doth take my muse and me,<br>
Is a pure cup of rich canary wine,<br>
Which is the Mermaid&rsquo;s now, but shall be mine:<br>
Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted,<br>
Their lives, as do their lines, till now had lasted.<br>
Tobacco, nectar, or the Thespian spring,<br>
Are all but Luther&rsquo;s beer, to this I sing.<br>
Of this we will sup free, but moderately,<br>
And we will have no Pooly&rsquo; or Parrot by;<br>
Nor shall our cups make any guilty men;<br>
But at our parting we will be as when<br>
We innocently met.&nbsp; No simple word<br>
That shall be uttered at our mirthful board,<br>
Shall make us sad next morning; or affright<br>
The liberty that we&rsquo;ll enjoy to-night.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EPITAPH ON SALATHIEL PAVY,<br>
A CHILD OF QUEEN ELIZABETH&rsquo;S CHAPEL<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Weep with me all you that read<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little story;<br>
And know for whom a tear you shed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death&rsquo;s self is sorry.<br>
&rsquo;Twas a child that so did thrive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grace and feature,<br>
As heaven and nature seemed to strive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which owned the creature.<br>
Years he numbered scarce thirteen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fates turned cruel;<br>
Yet three filled zodiacs had he been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage&rsquo;s jewel;<br>
And did act, what now we moan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old men so duly;<br>
As, sooth, the Parc&aelig; thought him one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He played so truly.<br>
So, by error to his fate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all consented;<br>
But viewing him since, alas, too late!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have repented;<br>
And have sought to give new birth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In baths to steep him;<br>
But, being so much too good for earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven vows to keep him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EPITAPH ON ELIZABETH, L. H.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Wouldst thou hear what man can say<br>
In a little?&nbsp; Reader, stay.<br>
Underneath this stone doth lie<br>
As much beauty as could die<br>
Which in life did harbour give<br>
To more virtue than doth live.<br>
If, at all, she had a fault<br>
Leave it buried in this vault.<br>
One name was Elizabeth,<br>
The other let it sleep with death.<br>
Fitter, where it died, to tell,<br>
Than that it lived at all.&nbsp; Farewell.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EPITAPH ON THE COUNTESS OF PEMBROKE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Underneath this sable hearse<br>
Lies the subject of all verse,<br>
Sidney&rsquo;s sister, Pembroke&rsquo;s mother:<br>
Death! ere thou hast slain another,<br>
Learned, and fair, and good as she,<br>
Time shall throw a dart at thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED MASTER WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE, AND WHAT HE HATH
LEFT US<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To draw no envy, Shakspeare, on thy name,<br>
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;<br>
While I confess thy writings to be such,<br>
As neither man, nor muse can praise too much.<br>
&rsquo;Tis true, and all men&rsquo;s suffrage.&nbsp; But these ways<br>
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;<br>
For silliest ignorance on these may light,<br>
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;<br>
Or blind affection, which doth ne&rsquo;er advance<br>
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;<br>
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,<br>
And think to ruin, where it seemed to raise.<br>
These are, as some infamous bawd, or whore,<br>
Should praise a matron; what would hurt her more?<br>
But thou art proof against them, and, indeed,<br>
Above the ill-fortune of them, or the need.<br>
I, therefore, will begin: Soul of the age!<br>
The applause! delight! and wonder of our stage!<br>
My Shakspeare rise!&nbsp; I will not lodge thee by<br>
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie<br>
A little further off, to make thee room:<br>
Thou art a monument without a tomb,<br>
And art alive still, while thy book doth live<br>
And we have wits to read, and praise to give.<br>
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,<br>
I mean with great, but disproportioned Muses;<br>
For if I thought my judgment were of years,<br>
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,<br>
And tell how far thou didst our Lily outshine,<br>
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlow&rsquo;s mighty line.<br>
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,<br>
From thence to honour thee, I will not seek<br>
For names: but call forth thundering Eschylus,<br>
Euripides, and Sophocles to us,<br>
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordoua dead,<br>
To live again, to hear thy buskin tread,<br>
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,<br>
Leave thee alone for the comparison<br>
Of all that insolent Greece, or haughty Rome<br>
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.<br>
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show,<br>
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.<br>
He was not of an age, but for all time!<br>
And all the Muses still were in their prime,<br>
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm<br>
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!<br>
Nature herself was proud of his designs,<br>
And joyed to wear the dressing of his lines!<br>
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit,<br>
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.<br>
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes,<br>
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please;<br>
But antiquated and deserted lie,<br>
As they were not of nature&rsquo;s family.<br>
Yet must I not give nature all; thy art,<br>
My gentle Shakspeare, must enjoy a part.<br>
For though the poet&rsquo;s matter nature be,<br>
His heart doth give the fashion: and, that he<br>
Who casts to write a living line, must sweat,<br>
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat<br>
Upon the Muse&rsquo;s anvil; turn the same,<br>
And himself with it, that he thinks to frame;<br>
Or for the laurel, he may gain a scorn;<br>
For a good poet&rsquo;s made, as well as born.<br>
And such wert thou!&nbsp; Look how the father&rsquo;s face<br>
Lives in his issue, even so the race<br>
Of Shakspeare&rsquo;s mind and manners brightly shines<br>
In his well-turn&egrave;d, and true fil&egrave;d lines;<br>
In each of which he seems to shake a lance,<br>
As brandished at the eyes of ignorance.<br>
Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were<br>
To see thee in our water yet appear,<br>
And make those flights upon the banks of Thames,<br>
That so did take Eliza, and our James!<br>
But stay, I see thee in the hemisphere<br>
Advanced, and made a constellation there!<br>
Shine forth, thou star of poets, and with rage,<br>
Or influence, chide, or cheer the drooping stage,<br>
Which, since thy flight from hence, hath mourned like night,<br>
And despairs day, but for thy volume&rsquo;s light.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TO CELIA<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Drink to me only with thine eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will pledge with mine;<br>
Or leave a kiss but in the cup,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ll not look for wine.<br>
The thirst that from the soul doth rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth ask a drink divine:<br>
But might I of Jove&rsquo;s nectar sup,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not change for thine.<br>
<br>
I sent thee late a rosy wreath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so much honouring thee,<br>
As giving it a hope that there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could not withered be.<br>
But thou thereon didst only breathe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sent&rsquo;st it back to me:<br>
Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not of itself, but thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THE TRIUMPH OF CHARIS<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the chariot at hand here of Love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein my lady rideth!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each that draws is a swan or a dove,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And well the car Love guideth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she goes, all hearts do duty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto her beauty;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, enamoured, do wish, so they might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But enjoy such
a sight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they still were to run by her side,<br>
Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do but look on her eyes, they do light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that Love&rsquo;s world compriseth!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do but look on her hair, it is bright<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Love&rsquo;s star when it riseth!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do but mark, her forehead&rsquo;s smoother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than words that
soothe her!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from her arched brows, such a grace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheds itself through
the face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As alone there triumphs to the life<br>
All the gain, all the good, of the elements&rsquo; strife.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you seen but a bright lily grow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before rude hands have touched it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you marked but the fall o&rsquo; the snow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the soil hath smutched it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you felt the wool of beaver?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or swan&rsquo;s
down ever?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or have smelt o&rsquo; the bud o&rsquo; the brier?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the nard in
the fire?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or have tasted the bag of the bee?<br>
O so white!&nbsp; O so soft!&nbsp; O so sweet is she!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
IN THE PERSON OF WOMANKIND<br>
A SONG APOLOGETIC<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Men, if you love us, play no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fools or tyrants with your friends,<br>
To make us still sing o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own false praises, for your ends:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have both wits and fancies too,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if we must, let&rsquo;s sing
of you.<br>
<br>
Nor do we doubt but that we can,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we would search with care and pain,<br>
Find some one good in some one man;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So going thorough all your strain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall, at last, of parcels make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One good enough for a song&rsquo;s
sake.<br>
<br>
And as a cunning painter takes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any curious piece you see,<br>
More pleasure while the thing he makes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than when &rsquo;tis made - why so will we.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having pleased our art, we&rsquo;ll
try<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a new, and hang that by.<br>
<br>

ODE<br>
<i>To the Immortal Memory and Friendship of that Noble Pair</i>,<i>
Sir Lucius Cary and Sir Henry Morison.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</i>I.<br>
<br>
THE TURN.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave infant of Saguntum, clear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy coming forth in that great year,<br>
When the prodigious Hannibal did crown<br>
His cage, with razing your immortal town.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, looking then about,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere thou wert half got out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise child, didst hastily return,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mad&rsquo;st thy mother&rsquo;s womb thine urn.<br>
How summed a circle didst thou leave mankind<br>
Of deepest lore, could we the centre find!<br>
<br>
THE COUNTER-TURN.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did wiser nature draw thee back,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From out the horror of that sack,<br>
Where shame, faith, honour, and regard of right,<br>
Lay trampled on? the deeds of death and night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged, hurried forth, and hurled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon th&rsquo; affrighted world;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sword, fire, and famine, with fell fury met,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all on utmost ruin set;<br>
As, could they but life&rsquo;s miseries foresee,<br>
No doubt all infants would return like thee.<br>
<br>
THE STAND.<br>
<br>
For what is life, if measured by the space<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not by the act?<br>
Or mask&egrave;d man, if valued by his face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above his fact?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s one outlived his peers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told forth fourscore years;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vex&egrave;d time, and busied the whole state;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troubled both foes and friends;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ever to no ends:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did this stirrer but die late?<br>
How well at twenty had he fallen or stood!<br>
For three of his fourscore he did no good.<br>
<br>
II.<br>
<br>
THE TURN<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered well, by virtuous parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got up, and thrived with honest arts;<br>
He purchased friends, and fame, and honours then,<br>
And had his noble name advanced with men:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But weary of that flight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stooped in all men&rsquo;s sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sordid flatteries,
acts of strife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sunk in that
dead sea of life,<br>
So deep, as he did then death&rsquo;s waters sup,<br>
But that the cork of title buoyed him up.<br>
<br>
THE COUNTER-TURN<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! but Morison fell young:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never fell, - thou fall&rsquo;st, my tongue.<br>
He stood a soldier to the last right end,<br>
A perfect patriot, and a noble friend;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most, a virtuous son.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All offices were done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By him, so ample, full, and round,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In weight, in measure, number, sound,<br>
As, though his age imperfect might appear,<br>
His life was of humanity the sphere.<br>
<br>
THE STAND<br>
<br>
Go now, and tell out days summed up with fears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make them years;<br>
Produce thy mass of miseries on the stage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To swell thine age;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat of things a throng,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show thou hast been long,<br>
Not lived: for life doth her great actions spell.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By what was done and wrought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In season, and so brought<br>
To light: her measures are, how well<br>
Each syllabe answered, and was formed, how fair;<br>
These make the lines of life, and that&rsquo;s her air!<br>
<br>
III.<br>
<br>
THE TURN<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not growing like a tree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bulk, doth make men better be;<br>
Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,<br>
To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sear:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lily of a day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is fairer far in May,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it fall and die that night;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the plant, and flower of light.<br>
In small proportions we just beauties see;<br>
And in short measures, life may perfect be.<br>
<br>
THE COUNTER-TURN<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, noble Lucius, then for wine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let thy looks with gladness shine:<br>
Accept this garland, plant it on thy head<br>
And think, nay know, thy Morison&rsquo;s not dead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaped the present age,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possessed with holy rage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see that bright eternal day;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which we priests and poets say,<br>
Such truths, as we expect for happy men:<br>
And there he lives with memory and Ben.<br>
<br>
THE STAND<br>
<br>
Jonson, who sung this of him, ere he went,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself to rest,<br>
Or taste a part of that full joy he meant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have expressed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this bright Asterism!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it were friendship&rsquo;s
schism,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were not his Lucius long with us to tarry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To separate these twi-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lights, the Dioscouri;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep the one half from his Harry,<br>
But fate doth so alternate the design<br>
Whilst that in heaven, this light on earth must shine.<br>
<br>
IV.<br>
<br>
THE TURN<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shine as you exalted are;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two names of friendship, but one star:<br>
Of hearts the union, and those not by chance<br>
Made, or indenture, or leased out t&rsquo;advance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The profits for a time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pleasures vain did chime,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rhymes, or riots, at your feasts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orgies of drink, or feigned protests:<br>
But simple love of greatness and of good,<br>
That knits brave minds and manners more than blood.<br>
<br>
THE COUNTER-TURN<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made you first to know the why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You liked, then after, to apply<br>
That liking; and approach so one the t&rsquo;other,<br>
Till either grew a portion of the other:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each styled by his end,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copy of his friend.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You lived to be the great sir-names,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And titles, by which all made claims<br>
Unto the virtue; nothing perfect done,<br>
But as a Cary, or a Morison.<br>
<br>
THE STAND<br>
<br>
And such a force the fair example had,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they that saw<br>
The good, and durst not practise it, were glad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such a law<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was left yet to mankind;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they might read and find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendship, indeed, was written not in words;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the heart, not pen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of two so early men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose lines her rolls were, and records;<br>
Who, ere the first down bloomed upon the chin,<br>
Had sowed these fruits, and got the harvest in.<br>
<br>
PR&AElig;LUDIUM<br>
<br>
And must I sing?&nbsp; What subject shall I choose!<br>
Or whose great name in poets&rsquo; heaven use,<br>
For the more countenance to my active muse?<br>
<br>
Hercules? alas, his bones are yet sore<br>
With his old earthly labours t&rsquo; exact more<br>
Of his dull godhead were sin.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll implore<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;bus.&nbsp; No, tend thy cart still.&nbsp; Envious day<br>
Shall not give out that I have made thee stay,<br>
And foundered thy hot team, to tune my lay.<br>
<br>
Nor will I beg of thee, lord of the vine,<br>
To raise my spirits with thy conjuring wine,<br>
In the green circle of thy ivy twine.<br>
<br>
Pallas, nor thee I call on, mankind maid,<br>
That at thy birth mad&rsquo;st the poor smith afraid.<br>
Who with his axe thy father&rsquo;s midwife played.<br>
<br>
Go, cramp dull Mars, light Venus, when he snorts,<br>
Or with thy tribade trine invent new sports;<br>
Thou, nor thy looseness with my making sorts.<br>
<br>
Let the old boy, your son, ply his old task,<br>
Turn the stale prologue to some painted mask;<br>
His absence in my verse is all I ask.<br>
<br>
Hermes, the cheater, shall not mix with us,<br>
Though he would steal his sisters&rsquo; Pegasus,<br>
And rifle him; or pawn his petasus.<br>
<br>
Nor all the ladies of the Thespian lake,<br>
Though they were crushed into one form, could make<br>
A beauty of that merit, that should take<br>
<br>
My muse up by commission; no, I bring<br>
My own true fire: now my thought takes wing,<br>
And now an epode to deep ears I sing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EPODE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Not to know vice at all, and keep true state,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is virtue and not fate:<br>
Next to that virtue, is to know vice well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her black spite expel.<br>
Which to effect (since no breast is so sure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or safe, but she&rsquo;ll procure<br>
Some way of entrance) we must plant a guard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thoughts to watch and ward<br>
At th&rsquo; eye and ear, the ports unto the mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That no strange, or unkind<br>
Object arrive there, but the heart, our spy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give knowledge instantly<br>
To wakeful reason, our affections&rsquo; king:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, in th&rsquo; examining,<br>
Will quickly taste the treason, and commit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close, the close cause of it.<br>
&rsquo;Tis the securest policy we have,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make our sense our slave.<br>
But this true course is not embraced by many:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By many! scarce by any.<br>
For either our affections do rebel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else the sentinel,<br>
That should ring &rsquo;larum to the heart, doth sleep:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or some great thought doth keep<br>
Back the intelligence, and falsely swears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re base and idle fears<br>
Whereof the loyal conscience so complains.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, by these subtle trains,<br>
Do several passions invade the mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strike our reason blind:<br>
Of which usurping rank, some have thought love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first: as prone to move<br>
Most frequent tumults, horrors, and unrests,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our inflam&egrave;d breasts:<br>
But this doth from the cloud of error grow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which thus we over-blow.<br>
The thing they here call love is blind desire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with bow, shafts, and fire;<br>
Inconstant, like the sea, of whence &rsquo;tis born,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough, swelling, like a storm;<br>
With whom who sails, rides on the surge of fear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And boils as if he were<br>
In a continual tempest.&nbsp; Now, true love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No such effects doth prove;<br>
That is an essence far more gentle, fine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure, perfect, nay, divine;<br>
It is a golden chain let down from heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose links are bright and even;<br>
That falls like sleep on lovers, and combines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft and sweetest minds<br>
In equal knots: this bears no brands, nor darts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To murder different hearts,<br>
But, in a calm and god-like unity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preserves community.<br>
O, who is he that, in this peace, enjoys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th&rsquo; elixir of all joys?<br>
A form more fresh than are the Eden bowers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lasting as her flowers;<br>
Richer than Time and, as Times&rsquo;s virtue, rare;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sober as saddest care;<br>
A fix&egrave;d thought, an eye untaught to glance;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, blest with such high chance,<br>
Would, at suggestion of a steep desire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast himself from the spire<br>
Of all his happiness?&nbsp; But soft: I hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some vicious fool draw near,<br>
That cries, we dream, and swears there&rsquo;s no such thing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this chaste love we sing.<br>
Peace, Luxury! thou art like one of those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, being at sea, suppose,<br>
Because they move, the continent doth so:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Vice, we let thee know<br>
Though thy wild thoughts with sparrows&rsquo; wings do fly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turtles can chastely die;<br>
And yet (in this t&rsquo; express ourselves more clear)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not number here<br>
Such spirits as are only continent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because lust&rsquo;s means are spent;<br>
Or those who doubt the common mouth of fame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for their place and name,<br>
Cannot so safely sin: their chastity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is mere necessity;<br>
Nor mean we those whom vows and conscience<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have filled with abstinence:<br>
Though we acknowledge who can so abstain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes a most bless&egrave;d gain;<br>
He that for love of goodness hateth ill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is more crown-worthy still<br>
Than he, which for sin&rsquo;s penalty forbears:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart sins, though he fears.<br>
But we propose a person like our Dove,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graced with a Ph&oelig;nix&rsquo; love;<br>
A beauty of that clear and sparkling light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would make a day of night,<br>
And turn the blackest sorrows to bright joys:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose odorous breath destroys<br>
All taste of bitterness, and makes the air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sweet as she is fair.<br>
A body so harmoniously composed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if nat&ugrave;re disclosed<br>
All her best symmetry in that one feature!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, so divine a creature<br>
Who could be false to? chiefly, when he knows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How only she bestows<br>
The wealthy treasure of her love on him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making his fortunes swim<br>
In the full flood of her admired perfection?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What savage, brute affection,<br>
Would not be fearful to offend a dame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this excelling frame?<br>
Much more a noble, and right generous mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To virtuous moods inclined,<br>
That knows the weight of guilt: he will refrain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thoughts of such a strain,<br>
And to his sense object this sentence ever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Man may securely sin, but safely never.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
AN ELEGY<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Though beauty be the mark of praise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yours, of whom I sing, be such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As not the world can praise too much,<br>
Yet is &lsquo;t your virtue now I raise.<br>
<br>
A virtue, like allay, so gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout your form, as though that move,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And draw, and conquer all men&rsquo;s love,<br>
This subjects you to love of one,<br>
<br>
Wherein you triumph yet: because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis of yourself, and that you use<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noblest freedom, not to choose<br>
Against or faith, or honour&rsquo;s laws.<br>
<br>
But who could less expect from you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In whom alone Love lives again?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By whom he is restored to men;<br>
And kept, and bred, and brought up true?<br>
<br>
His falling temples you have reared,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The withered garlands ta&rsquo;en away;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His altars kept from the decay<br>
That envy wished, and nature feared;<br>
<br>
And on them burns so chaste a flame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With so much loyalty&rsquo;s expense,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Love, t&rsquo; acquit such excellence,<br>
Is gone himself into your name.<br>
<br>
And you are he: the deity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom all lovers are designed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would their better objects find;<br>
Among which faithful troop am I;<br>
<br>
Who, as an offering at your shrine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have sung this hymn, and here entreat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One spark of your diviner heat<br>
To light upon a love of mine;<br>
<br>
Which, if it kindle not, but scant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appear, and that to shortest view,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet give me leave t&rsquo; adore in you<br>
What I, in her, am grieved to want.<br>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the

     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
