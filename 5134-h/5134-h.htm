<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ben Jonson&rsquo;s</span>
&ldquo;Discoveries&rdquo; are, as he says in the few Latin words
prefixed to them, &ldquo;A wood&mdash;Sylva&mdash;of things and
thoughts, in Greek &lsquo;&#8021;&lambda;&eta;&rsquo;&rdquo;
[which has for its first meaning material, but is also applied
peculiarly to kinds of wood, and to a wood], &ldquo;from the
multiplicity and variety of the material contained in it.&nbsp;
For, as we are commonly used to call the infinite mixed multitude
of growing trees a wood, so the ancients gave the name of
Sylv&aelig;&mdash;Timber Trees&mdash;to books of theirs in which
small works of various and diverse matter were promiscuously
brought together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this little book we have some of the best thoughts of one
of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of
English literature.&nbsp; The songs added are a part of what Ben
Jonson called his &ldquo;Underwoods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben Jonson was of a north-country family from the Annan
district that produced Thomas Carlyle.&nbsp; His father was
ruined by religious persecution in the reign of Mary, became a
preacher in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, and died a month before the
poet&rsquo;s birth in 1573.&nbsp; Ben Jonson, therefore, was
about nine years younger than Shakespeare, and he survived
Shakespeare about twenty-one years, dying in August, 1637.&nbsp;
Next to Shakespeare Ben Jonson was, in his own different way, the
man of most mark in the story of the English drama.&nbsp; His
mother, left poor, married again.&nbsp; Her second husband was a
bricklayer, or small builder, and they lived for a time near
Charing Cross in Hartshorn Lane.&nbsp; Ben Jonson was taught at
the parish school of St. Martin&rsquo;s till he was discovered by
William Camden, the historian.&nbsp; Camden was then second
master in Westminster School.&nbsp; He procured for young Ben an
admission into his school, and there laid firm foundations for
that scholarship which the poet extended afterwards by private
study until his learning grew to be sworn-brother to his wit.</p>
<p>Ben Jonson began the world poor.&nbsp; He worked for a very
short time in his step-father&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; He
volunteered to the wars in the Low Countries.&nbsp; He came home
again, and joined the players.&nbsp; Before the end of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign he had written three or four plays, in
which he showed a young and ardent zeal for setting the world to
rights, together with that high sense of the poet&rsquo;s calling
which put lasting force into his work.&nbsp; He poured contempt
on those who frittered life away.&nbsp; He urged on the
poetasters and the mincing courtiers, who set their hearts on
top-knots and affected movements of their lips and
legs:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;That these vain joys in which their
wills consume<br />
Such powers of wit and soul as are of force<br />
To raise their beings to eternity,<br />
May be converted on works fitting men;<br />
And for the practice of a forc&eacute;d look,<br />
An antic gesture, or a fustian phrase,<br />
Study the native frame of a true heart,<br />
An inward comeliness of bounty, knowledge,<br />
And spirit that may conform them actually<br />
To God&rsquo;s high figures, which they have in power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben Jonson&rsquo;s genius was producing its best work in the
earlier years of the reign of James I.&nbsp; His <i>Volpone</i>,
the <i>Silent Woman</i>, and the <i>Alchemist</i> first appeared
side by side with some of the ripest works of Shakespeare in the
years from 1605 to 1610.&nbsp; In the latter part of
James&rsquo;s reign he produced masques for the Court, and turned
with distaste from the public stage.&nbsp; When Charles I. became
king, Ben Jonson was weakened in health by a paralytic
stroke.&nbsp; He returned to the stage for a short time through
necessity, but found his best friends in the best of the young
poets of the day.&nbsp; These looked up to him as their father
and their guide.&nbsp; Their own best efforts seemed best to them
when they had won Ben Jonson&rsquo;s praise.&nbsp; They valued
above all passing honours man could give the words, &ldquo;My
son,&rdquo; in the old poet&rsquo;s greeting, which, as they
said, &ldquo;sealed them of the tribe of Ben.&rdquo;</p>

Sat. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Fortuna</i>.&mdash;Ill fortune never crushed that man whom
good fortune deceived not.&nbsp; I therefore have counselled my
friends never to trust to her fairer side, though she seemed to
make peace with them; but to place all things she gave them, so
as she might ask them again without their trouble, she might take
them from them, not pull them: to keep always a distance between
her and themselves.&nbsp; He knows not his own strength that hath
not met adversity.&nbsp; Heaven prepares good men with crosses;
but no ill can happen to a good man.&nbsp; Contraries are not
mixed.&nbsp; Yet that which happens to any man may to every
man.&nbsp; But it is in his reason, what he accounts it and will
make it.</p>
<p><i>Casus</i>.&mdash;Change into extremity is very frequent and
easy.&nbsp; As when a beggar suddenly grows rich, he commonly
becomes a prodigal; for, to obscure his former obscurity, he puts
on riot and excess.</p>
<p><i>Consilia</i>.&mdash;No man is so foolish but may give
another good counsel sometimes; and no man is so wise but may
easily err, if he will take no others&rsquo; counsel but his
own.&nbsp; But very few men are wise by their own counsel, or
learned by their own teaching.&nbsp; For he that was only taught
by himself <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a> had a fool to his master.</p>
<p><i>Fama</i>.&mdash;A Fame that is wounded to the world would
be better cured by another&rsquo;s apology than its own: for few
can apply medicines well themselves.&nbsp; Besides, the man that
is once hated, both his good and his evil deeds oppress
him.&nbsp; He is not easily emergent.</p>
<p><i>Negotia</i>.&mdash;In great affairs it is a work of
difficulty to please all.&nbsp; And ofttimes we lose the
occasions of carrying a business well and thoroughly by our too
much haste.&nbsp; For passions are spiritual rebels, and raise
sedition against the understanding.</p>
<p><i>Amor patri&aelig;</i>.&mdash;There is a necessity all men
should love their country: he that professeth the contrary may be
delighted with his words, but his heart is there.</p>
<p><i>Ingenia</i>.&mdash;Natures that are hardened to evil you
shall sooner break than make straight; they are like poles that
are crooked and dry, there is no attempting them.</p>
<p><i>Applausus</i>.&mdash;We praise the things we hear with much
more willingness than those we see, because we envy the present
and reverence the past; thinking ourselves instructed by the one,
and overlaid by the other.</p>
<p><i>Opinio</i>.&mdash;Opinion is a light, vain, crude, and
imperfect thing; settled in the imagination, but never arriving
at the understanding, there to obtain the tincture of
reason.&nbsp; We labour with it more than truth.&nbsp; There is
much more holds us than presseth us.&nbsp; An ill fact is one
thing, an ill fortune is another; yet both oftentimes sway us
alike, by the error of our thinking.</p>
<p><i>Impostura</i>.&mdash;Many men believe not themselves what
they would persuade others; and less do the things which they
would impose on others; but least of all know what they
themselves most confidently boast.&nbsp; Only they set the sign
of the cross over their outer doors, and sacrifice to their gut
and their groin in their inner closets.</p>
<p><i>Jactura vit&aelig;</i>.&mdash;What a deal of cold business
doth a man misspend the better part of life in! in scattering
compliments, tendering visits, gathering and venting news,
following feasts and plays, making a little winter-love in a dark
corner.</p>
<p>Hypocrita.&mdash;<i>Puritanus Hypocrita est
H&aelig;reticus</i>, <i>quem opinio propri&aelig;
perspicaci&aelig;</i>, <i>qu&acirc; sibi videtur</i>, <i>cum
paucis in Ecclesi&acirc; dogmatibus errores quosdam
animadvertisse</i>, <i>de statu mentis deturbavit: unde sacro
furore percitus</i>, <i>phrenetice pugnat contra magistratus</i>,
<i>sic ratus obedientiam pr&aelig;stare Deo</i>. <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a></p>
<p><i>Mutua auxilia</i>.&mdash;Learning needs rest: sovereignty
gives it.&nbsp; Sovereignty needs counsel: learning affords
it.&nbsp; There is such a consociation of offices between the
prince and whom his favour breeds, that they may help to sustain
his power as he their knowledge.&nbsp; It is the greatest part of
his liberality, his favour; and from whom doth he hear discipline
more willingly, or the arts discoursed more gladly, than from
those whom his own bounty and benefits have made able and
faithful?</p>
<p><i>Cognit. univers</i>.&mdash;In being able to counsel others,
a man must be furnished with a universal store in himself, to the
knowledge of all nature&mdash;that is, the matter and seed-plot:
there are the seats of all argument and invention.&nbsp; But
especially you must be cunning in the nature of man: there is the
variety of things which are as the elements and letters, which
his art and wisdom must rank and order to the present
occasion.&nbsp; For we see not all letters in single words, nor
all places in particular discourses.&nbsp; That cause seldom
happens wherein a man will use all arguments.</p>
<p><i>Consiliarii adjunct</i>.&nbsp; <i>Probitas</i>,
<i>Sapientia</i>.&mdash;The two chief things that give a man
reputation in counsel are the opinion of his honesty and the
opinion of his wisdom: the authority of those two will persuade
when the same counsels uttered by other persons less qualified
are of no efficacy or working.</p>
<p><i>Vita recta</i>.&mdash;Wisdom without honesty is mere craft
and cozenage.&nbsp; And therefore the reputation of honesty must
first be gotten, which cannot be but by living well.&nbsp; A good
life is a main argument.</p>

<p><i>Obsequentia</i>.&mdash;<i>Humanitas</i>.&mdash;<i>Solicitudo</i>.&mdash;Next
a good life, to beget love in the persons we counsel, by
dissembling our knowledge of ability in ourselves, and avoiding
all suspicion of arrogance, ascribing all to their instruction,
as an ambassador to his master, or a subject to his sovereign;
seasoning all with humanity and sweetness, only expressing care
and solicitude.&nbsp; And not to counsel rashly, or on the
sudden, but with advice and meditation.&nbsp; (<i>Dat nox
consilium</i>. <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a>)&nbsp; For many foolish things fall
from wise men, if they speak in haste or be extemporal.&nbsp; It
therefore behoves the giver of counsel to be circumspect;
especially to beware of those with whom he is not thoroughly
acquainted, lest any spice of rashness, folly, or self-love
appear, which will be marked by new persons and men of experience
in affairs.</p>
<p><i>Modestia</i>.&mdash;<i>Parrhesia</i>.&mdash;And to the
prince, or his superior, to behave himself modestly and with
respect.&nbsp; Yet free from flattery or empire.&nbsp; Not with
insolence or precept; but as the prince were already furnished
with the parts he should have, especially in affairs of
state.&nbsp; For in other things they will more easily suffer
themselves to be taught or reprehended: they will not willingly
contend, but hear, with Alexander, the answer the musician gave
him: <i>Absit</i>, <i>o rex</i>, <i>ut tu meli&ugrave;s h&aelig;c
scias</i>, <i>qu&agrave;m ego</i>. <a name="citation17b"></a><a
href="#footnote17b" class="citation">[17b]</a></p>
<p><i>Perspicuitas</i>.&mdash;<i>Elegantia</i>.&mdash;A man
should so deliver himself to the nature of the subject whereof he
speaks, that his hearer may take knowledge of his discipline with
some delight; and so apparel fair and good matter, that the
studious of elegancy be not defrauded; redeem arts from their
rough and braky seats, where they lay hid and overgrown with
thorns, to a pure, open, and flowery light, where they may take
the eye and be taken by the hand.</p>
<p><i>Natura non eff&aelig;ta</i>.&mdash;I cannot think Nature is
so spent and decayed that she can bring forth nothing worth her
former years.&nbsp; She is always the same, like herself; and
when she collects her strength is abler still.&nbsp; Men are
decayed, and studies: she is not.</p>
<p><i>Non nimi&ugrave;m credendum antiquitati</i>.&mdash;I know
nothing can conduce more to letters than to examine the writings
of the ancients, and not to rest in their sole authority, or take
all upon trust from them, provided the plagues of judging and
pronouncing against them be away; such as are envy, bitterness,
precipitation, impudence, and scurrilous scoffing.&nbsp; For to
all the observations of the ancients we have our own experience,
which if we will use and apply, we have better means to
pronounce.&nbsp; It is true they opened the gates, and made the
way that went before us, but as guides, not commanders: <i>Non
domini nostri</i>, <i>sed duces fu&ecirc;re</i>. <a
name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a"
class="citation">[19a]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Truth lies open to all; it
is no man&rsquo;s several.&nbsp; <i>Patet omnibus veritas</i>;
<i>nondum est occupata</i>.&nbsp; <i>Multum ex ill&acirc;</i>,
<i>etiam futuris relicta est</i>. <a name="citation19b"></a><a
href="#footnote19b" class="citation">[19b]</a></p>
<p><i>Dissentire licet</i>, <i>sed cum ratione</i>.&mdash;If in
some things I dissent from others, whose wit, industry,
diligence, and judgment, I look up at and admire, let me not
therefore hear presently of ingratitude and rashness.&nbsp; For I
thank those that have taught me, and will ever; but yet dare not
think the scope of their labour and inquiry was to envy their
posterity what they also could add and find out.</p>
<p><i>Non mihi credendum sed veritati</i>.&mdash;If I err, pardon
me: <i>Nulla ars simul et inventa est et absoluta</i>. <a
name="citation19c"></a><a href="#footnote19c"
class="citation">[19c]</a>&nbsp; I do not desire to be equal to
those that went before; but to have my reason examined with
theirs, and so much faith to be given them, or me, as those shall
evict.&nbsp; I am neither author nor fautor of any sect.&nbsp; I
will have no man addict himself to me; but if I have anything
right, defend it as Truth&rsquo;s, not mine, save as it conduceth
to a common good.&nbsp; It profits not me to have any man fence
or fight for me, to flourish, or take my side.&nbsp; Stand for
truth, and &rsquo;tis enough.</p>
<p><i>Scienti&aelig; liberales</i>.&mdash;Arts that respect the
mind were ever reputed nobler than those that serve the body,
though we less can be without them, as tillage, spinning,
weaving, building, &amp;c., without which we could scarce sustain
life a day.&nbsp; But these were the works of every hand; the
other of the brain only, and those the most generous and exalted
wits and spirits, that cannot rest or acquiesce.&nbsp; The mind
of man is still fed with labour: <i>Opere pascitur</i>.</p>
<p><i>Non vulgi sunt</i>.&mdash;There is a more secret cause, and
the power of liberal studies lies more hid than that it can be
wrought out by profane wits.&nbsp; It is not every man&rsquo;s
way to hit.&nbsp; There are men, I confess, that set the carat
and value upon things as they love them; but science is not every
man&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp; It is as great a spite to be praised
in the wrong place, and by a wrong person, as can be done to a
noble nature.</p>
<p><i>Honesta ambitio</i>.&mdash;If divers men seek fame or
honour by divers ways, so both be honest, neither is to be
blamed; but they that seek immortality are not only worthy of
love, but of praise.</p>
<p><i>Maritus improbus</i>.&mdash;He hath a delicate wife, a fair
fortune, a family to go to and be welcome; yet he had rather be
drunk with mine host and the fiddlers of such a town, than go
home.</p>
<p><i>Afflictio pia magistra</i>.&mdash;Affliction teacheth a
wicked person some time to pray: prosperity never.</p>
<p><i>Deploratis facilis descensus Averni</i>.&mdash;<i>The devil
take all</i>.&mdash;Many might go to heaven with half the labour
they go to hell, if they would venture their industry the right
way; but &ldquo;The devil take all!&rdquo; quoth he that was
choked in the mill-dam, with his four last words in his
mouth.</p>
<p><i>&AElig;gidius cursu superat</i>.&mdash;A cripple in the way
out-travels a footman or a post out of the way.</p>
<p><i>Prodigo nummi nauci</i>.&mdash;Bags of money to a prodigal
person are the same that cherry-stones are with some boys, and so
thrown away.</p>
<p><i>Munda et sordida</i>.&mdash;A woman, the more curious she
is about her face is commonly the more careless about her
house.</p>
<p><i>Debitum deploratum</i>.&mdash;Of this spilt water there is
a little to be gathered up: it is a desperate debt.</p>
<p><i>Latro sesquipedalis</i>.&mdash;The thief <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a> that had a longing at the gallows to
commit one robbery more before he was hanged.</p>
<p>And like the German lord, when he went out of Newgate into the
cart, took order to have his arms set up in his last herborough:
said was he taken and committed upon suspicion of treason, no
witness appearing against him; but the judges entertained him
most civilly, discoursed with him, offered him the courtesy of
the rack; but he confessed, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i>Calumni&aelig; fructus</i>.&mdash;I am beholden to calumny,
that she hath so endeavoured and taken pains to belie me.&nbsp;
It shall make me set a surer guard on myself, and keep a better
watch upon my actions.</p>
<p><i>Impertinens</i>.&mdash;A tedious person is one a man would
leap a steeple from, gallop down any steep lull to avoid him;
forsake his meat, sleep, nature itself, with all her benefits, to
shun him.&nbsp; A mere impertinent; one that touched neither
heaven nor earth in his discourse.&nbsp; He opened an entry into
a fair room, but shut it again presently.&nbsp; I spoke to him of
garlic, he answered asparagus; consulted him of marriage, he
tells me of hanging, as if they went by one and the same
destiny.</p>
<p><i>Bellum scribentium</i>.&mdash;What a sight it is to see
writers committed together by the ears for ceremonies, syllables,
points, colons, commas, hyphens, and the like, fighting as for
their fires and their altars; and angry that none are frighted at
their noises and loud brayings under their asses&rsquo;
skins.</p>
<p>There is hope of getting a fortune without digging in these
quarries.&nbsp; <i>Sed meliore (in omne) ingenio animoque
qu&agrave;m fortun&acirc;</i>, <i>sum usus</i>. <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pingue solum lassat; sed juvat ipse labor.&rdquo; <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a></p>
<p><i>Differentia inter doctos et sciolos</i>.&mdash;Wits made
out their several expeditions then for the discovery of truth, to
find out great and profitable knowledges; had their several
instruments for the disquisition of arts.&nbsp; Now there are
certain scioli or smatterers that are busy in the skirts and
outsides of learning, and have scarce anything of solid
literature to commend them.&nbsp; They may have some edging or
trimming of a scholar, a welt or so; but it is no more.</p>
<p><i>Impostorum fucus</i>.&mdash;Imposture is a specious thing,
yet never worse than when it feigns to be best, and to none
discovered sooner than the simplest.&nbsp; For truth and goodness
are plain and open; but imposture is ever ashamed of the
light.</p>
<p><i>Icunculorum motio</i>.&mdash;A puppet-play must be shadowed
and seen in the dark; for draw the curtain, <i>et sordet
gesticulatio</i>. <a name="citation24b"></a><a
href="#footnote24b" class="citation">[24b]</a></p>
<p><i>Principes et administri</i>.&mdash;There is a great
difference in the understanding of some princes, as in the
quality of their ministers about them.&nbsp; Some would dress
their masters in gold, pearl, and all true jewels of majesty;
others furnish them with feathers, bells, and ribands, and are
therefore esteemed the fitter servants.&nbsp; But they are ever

Spaniards, <i>Artes inter h&aelig;redes non dividi</i>. <a
name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a>&nbsp; Yet these have inherited their
fathers&rsquo; lying, and they brag of it.&nbsp; He is a
narrow-minded man that affects a triumph in any glorious study;
but to triumph in a lie, and a lie themselves have forged, is
frontless.&nbsp; Folly often goes beyond her bounds; but
Impudence knows none.</p>
<p><i>Non nova res livor</i>.&mdash;Envy is no new thing, nor was
it born only in our times.&nbsp; The ages past have brought it
forth, and the coming ages will.&nbsp; So long as there are men
fit for it, <i>quorum odium virtute relict&acirc; placet</i>, it
will never be wanting.&nbsp; It is a barbarous envy, to take from
those men&rsquo;s virtues which, because thou canst not arrive
at, thou impotently despairest to imitate.&nbsp; Is it a crime in
me that I know that which others had not yet known but from me?
or that I am the author of many things which never would have
come in thy thought but that I taught them?&nbsp; It is new but a
foolish way you have found out, that whom you cannot equal or
come near in doing, you would destroy or ruin with evil speaking;
as if you had bound both your wits and natures &rsquo;prentices
to slander, and then came forth the best artificers when you
could form the foulest calumnies.</p>
<p><i>Nil gratius protervo lib</i>.&mdash;Indeed nothing is of
more credit or request now than a petulant paper, or scoffing
verses; and it is but convenient to the times and manners we live
with, to have then the worst writings and studies flourish when
the best begin to be despised.&nbsp; Ill arts begin where good
end.</p>
<p><i>Jam liter&aelig; sordent</i>.&mdash;<i>Pastus hodiern.
ingen</i>.&mdash;The time was when men would learn and study good
things, not envy those that had them.&nbsp; Then men were had in
price for learning; now letters only make men vile.&nbsp; He is
upbraidingly called a poet, as if it were a contemptible
nick-name: but the professors, indeed, have made the learning
cheap&mdash;railing and tinkling rhymers, whose writings the
vulgar more greedily read, as being taken with the scurrility and
petulancy of such wits.&nbsp; He shall not have a reader now
unless he jeer and lie.&nbsp; It is the food of men&rsquo;s
natures; the diet of the times; gallants cannot sleep else.&nbsp;
The writer must lie and the gentle reader rests happy to hear the
worthiest works misinterpreted, the clearest actions obscured,
the innocentest life traduced: and in such a licence of lying, a
field so fruitful of slanders, how can there be matter wanting to
his laughter?&nbsp; Hence comes the epidemical infection; for how
can they escape the contagion of the writings, whom the virulency
of the calumnies hath not staved off from reading?</p>
<p><i>Sed seculi morbus</i>.&mdash;Nothing doth more invite a
greedy reader than an unlooked-for subject.&nbsp; And what more
unlooked-for than to see a person of an unblamed life made
ridiculous or odious by the artifice of lying?&nbsp; But it is
the disease of the age; and no wonder if the world, growing old,
begin to be infirm: old age itself is a disease.&nbsp; It is long
since the sick world began to dote and talk idly: would she had
but doted still! but her dotage is now broke forth into a
madness, and become a mere frenzy.</p>
<p><i>Alastoris malitia</i>.&mdash;This Alastor, who hath left
nothing unsearched or unassailed by his impudent and licentious
lying in his aguish writings (for he was in his cold quaking fit
all the while), what hath he done more than a troublesome base
cur? barked and made a noise afar off; had a fool or two to spit
in his mouth, and cherish him with a musty bone?&nbsp; But they
are rather enemies of my fame than me, these barkers.</p>
<p><i>Mali Choragi fuere</i>.&mdash;It is an art to have so much
judgment as to apparel a lie well, to give it a good dressing;
that though the nakedness would show deformed and odious, the
suiting of it might draw their readers.&nbsp; Some love any
strumpet, be she never so shop-like or meretricious, in good
clothes.&nbsp; But these, nature could not have formed them
better to destroy their own testimony and overthrow their
calumny.</p>
<p><i>Hear-say news</i>.&mdash;That an elephant, in 1630, came
hither ambassador from the Great Mogul, who could both write and
read, and was every day allowed twelve cast of bread, twenty
quarts of Canary sack, besides nuts and almonds the
citizens&rsquo; wives sent him.&nbsp; That he had a Spanish boy
to his interpreter, and his chief negociation was to confer or
practise with Archy, the principal fool of state, about stealing
hence Windsor Castle and carrying it away on his back if he
can.</p>
<p><i>Lingua sapientis</i>, <i>potius qu&acirc;m
loquentis</i>.&mdash;A wise tongue should not be licentious and
wandering; but moved and, as it were, governed with certain reins
from the heart and bottom of the breast: and it was excellently
said of that philosopher, that there was a wall or parapet of
teeth set in our mouth, to restrain the petulancy of our words;
that the rashness of talking should not only be retarded by the
guard and watch of our heart, but be fenced in and defended by
certain strengths placed in the mouth itself, and within the
lips.&nbsp; But you shall see some so abound with words, without
any seasoning or taste of matter, in so profound a security, as
while they are speaking, for the most part they confess to speak
they know not what.</p>
<p>Of the two (if either were to be wished) I would rather have a
plain downright wisdom, than a foolish and affected
eloquence.&nbsp; For what is so furious and Bedlam like as a vain
sound of chosen and excellent words, without any subject of
sentence or science mixed?</p>
<p><i>Optanda</i>.&mdash;<i>Thersites Homeri</i>.&mdash;Whom the
disease of talking still once possesseth, he can never hold his
peace.&nbsp; Nay, rather than he will not discourse he will hire
men to hear him.&nbsp; And so heard, not hearkened unto, he comes
off most times like a mountebank, that when he hath praised his
medicines, finds none will take them, or trust him.&nbsp; He is
like Homer&rsquo;s <i>Thersites</i>.</p>

man before he speaks; and Epaminondas is celebrated by Pindar to
be a man that, though he knew much, yet he spoke but
little.&nbsp; Demacatus, when on the bench he was long silent and
said nothing, one asking him if it were folly in him, or want of
language, he answered, &ldquo;A fool could never hold his
peace.&rdquo; <a name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c"

<p>Nor is that worthy speech of Zeno the philosopher to be passed
over with the note of ignorance; who being invited to a feast in
Athens, where a great prince&rsquo;s ambassadors were
entertained, and was the only person that said nothing at the
table; one of them with courtesy asked him, &ldquo;What shall we
return from thee, Zeno, to the prince our master, if he asks us
of thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;more but that you found an old man in Athens that knew to
be silent amongst his cups.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was near a miracle to
see an old man silent, since talking is the disease of age; but
amongst cups makes it fully a wonder.</p>

<p><i>Acutius cernuntur vitia quam virtutes</i>.&mdash;There is
almost no man but he sees clearlier and sharper the vices in a
speaker, than the virtues.&nbsp; And there are many, that with
more ease will find fault with what is spoken foolishly than can
give allowance to that wherein you are wise silently.&nbsp; The
treasure of a fool is always in his tongue, said the witty comic
poet; <a name="citation33c"></a><a href="#footnote33c"
class="citation">[33c]</a> and it appears not in anything more
than in that nation, whereof one, when he had got the inheritance
of an unlucky old grange, would needs sell it; <a
name="citation33d"></a><a href="#footnote33d"
class="citation">[33d]</a> and to draw buyers proclaimed the
virtues of it.&nbsp; Nothing ever thrived on it, saith he.&nbsp;
No owner of it ever died in his bed; some hung, some drowned
themselves; some were banished, some starved; the trees were all
blasted; the swine died of the measles, the cattle of the
murrain, the sheep of the rot; they that stood were ragged, bare,
and bald as your hand; nothing was ever reared there, not a
duckling, or a goose.&nbsp; <i>Hospitium fuerat calamitatis</i>.
<a name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a>&nbsp; Was not this man like to sell
it?</p>
<p><i>Vulgi expectatio</i>.&mdash;Expectation of the vulgar is
more drawn and held with newness than goodness; we see it in
fencers, in players, in poets, in preachers, in all where fame
promiseth anything; so it be new, though never so naught and
depraved, they run to it, and are taken.&nbsp; Which shews, that
the only decay or hurt of the best men&rsquo;s reputation with
the people is, their wits have out-lived the people&rsquo;s
palates.&nbsp; They have been too much or too long a feast.</p>
<p><i>Claritas patri&aelig;</i>.&mdash;Greatness of name in the
father oft-times helps not forth, but overwhelms the son; they
stand too near one another.&nbsp; The shadow kills the growth: so
much, that we see the grandchild come more and oftener to be heir
of the first, than doth the second: he dies between; the
possession is the third&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><i>Eloquentia</i>.&mdash;Eloquence is a great and diverse
thing: nor did she yet ever favour any man so much as to become
wholly his.&nbsp; He is happy that can arrive to any degree of
her grace.&nbsp; Yet there are who prove themselves masters of
her, and absolute lords; but I believe they may mistake their
evidence: for it is one thing to be eloquent in the schools, or
in the hall; another at the bar, or in the pulpit.&nbsp; There is
a difference between mooting and pleading; between fencing and
fighting.&nbsp; To make arguments in my study, and confute them,
is easy; where I answer myself, not an adversary.&nbsp; So I can
see whole volumes dispatched by the umbratical doctors on all
sides: but draw these forth into the just lists: let them appear
<i>sub dio</i>, and they are changed with the place, like bodies
bred in the shade; they cannot suffer the sun or a shower, nor
bear the open air; they scarce can find themselves, that they
were wont to domineer so among their auditors: but indeed I would
no more choose a rhetorician for reigning in a school, than I
would a pilot for rowing in a pond.</p>
<p><i>Amor et odium</i>.&mdash;Love that is ignorant, and hatred,
have almost the same ends: many foolish lovers wish the same to
their friends, which their enemies would: as to wish a friend
banished, that they might accompany him in exile; or some great
want, that they might relieve him; or a disease, that they might
sit by him.&nbsp; They make a causeway to their country by
injury, as if it were not honester to do nothing than to seek a
way to do good by a mischief.</p>
<p><i>Injuria</i>.&mdash;Injuries do not extinguish courtesies:
they only suffer them not to appear fair.&nbsp; For a man that
doth me an injury after a courtesy, takes not away that courtesy,
but defaces it: as he that writes other verses upon my verses,
takes not away the first letters, but hides them.</p>
<p><i>Beneficia</i>.&mdash;Nothing is a courtesy unless it be
meant us; and that friendly and lovingly.&nbsp; We owe no thanks
to rivers, that they carry our boats; or winds, that they be
favouring and fill our sails; or meats, that they be
nourishing.&nbsp; For these are what they are necessarily.&nbsp;
Horses carry us, trees shade us, but they know it not.&nbsp; It
is true, some men may receive a courtesy and not know it; but
never any man received it from him that knew it not.&nbsp; Many
men have been cured of diseases by accidents; but they were not
remedies.&nbsp; I myself have known one helped of an ague by
falling into a water; another whipped out of a fever; but no man
would ever use these for medicines.&nbsp; It is the mind, and not
the event, that distinguisheth the courtesy from wrong.&nbsp; My
adversary may offend the judge with his pride and impertinences,
and I win my cause; but he meant it not to me as a
courtesy.&nbsp; I scaped pirates by being shipwrecked; was the
wreck a benefit therefore?&nbsp; No; the doing of courtesies
aright is the mixing of the respects for his own sake and for
mine.&nbsp; He that doeth them merely for his own sake is like
one that feeds his cattle to sell them; he hath his horse well
dressed for Smithfield.</p>
<p><i>Valor rerum</i>.&mdash;The price of many things is far
above what they are bought and sold for.&nbsp; Life and health,
which are both inestimable, we have of the physician; as learning
and knowledge, the true tillage of the mind, from our
schoolmasters.&nbsp; But the fees of the one or the salary of the
other never answer the value of what we received, but served to
gratify their labours.</p>
<p><i>Memoria</i>.&mdash;Memory, of all the powers of the mind,
is the most delicate and frail; it is the first of our faculties
that age invades.&nbsp; Seneca, the father, the rhetorician,
confesseth of himself he had a miraculous one, not only to
receive but to hold.&nbsp; I myself could, in my youth, have
repeated all that ever I had made, and so continued till I was
past forty; since, it is much decayed in me.&nbsp; Yet I can
repeat whole books that I have read, and poems of some selected
friends which I have liked to charge my memory with.&nbsp; It was
wont to be faithful to me; but shaken with age now, and sloth,
which weakens the strongest abilities, it may perform somewhat,
but cannot promise much.&nbsp; By exercise it is to be made
better and serviceable.&nbsp; Whatsoever I pawned with it while I
was young and a boy, it offers me readily, and without stops; but
what I trust to it now, or have done of later years, it lays up
more negligently, and oftentimes loses; so that I receive mine
own (though frequently called for) as if it were new and
borrowed.&nbsp; Nor do I always find presently from it what I
seek; but while I am doing another thing, that I laboured for
will come; and what I sought with trouble will offer itself when
I am quiet.&nbsp; Now, in some men I have found it as happy as
Nature, who, whatsoever they read or pen, they can say without
book presently, as if they did then write in their mind.&nbsp;
And it is more a wonder in such as have a swift style, for their
memories are commonly slowest; such as torture their writings,
and go into council for every word, must needs fix somewhat, and
make it their own at last, though but through their own
vexation.</p>
<p><i>Comit. suffragia</i>.&mdash;Suffrages in Parliament are
numbered, not weighed; nor can it be otherwise in those public
councils where nothing is so unequal as the equality; for there,
how odd soever men&rsquo;s brains or wisdoms are, their power is
always even and the same.</p>
<p><i>Stare &agrave; partibus</i>.&mdash;Some actions, be they
never so beautiful and generous, are often obscured by base and
vile misconstructions, either out of envy or ill-nature, that
judgeth of others as of itself.&nbsp; Nay, the times are so
wholly grown to be either partial or malicious, that if he be a
friend all sits well about him, his very vices shall be virtues;
if an enemy, or of the contrary faction, nothing is good or
tolerable in him; insomuch that we care not to discredit and
shame our judgments to soothe our passions.</p>
<p><i>Deus in creaturis</i>.&mdash;Man is read in his face; God
in His creatures; not as the philosopher, the creature of glory,
reads him; but as the divine, the servant of humility; yet even
he must take care not to be too curious.&nbsp; For to utter truth
of God but as he thinks only, may be dangerous, who is best known
by our not knowing.&nbsp; Some things of Him, so much as He hath
revealed or commanded, it is not only lawful but necessary for us
to know; for therein our ignorance was the first cause of our
wickedness.</p>
<p><i>Veritas proprium hominis</i>.&mdash;Truth is man&rsquo;s
proper good, and the only immortal thing was given to our
mortality to use.&nbsp; No good Christian or ethnic, if he be
honest, can miss it; no statesman or patriot should.&nbsp; For
without truth all the actions of mankind are craft, malice, or
what you will, rather than wisdom.&nbsp; Homer says he hates him
worse than hell-mouth that utters one thing with his tongue and
keeps another in his breast.&nbsp; Which high expression was
grounded on divine reason; for a lying mouth is a stinking pit,
and murders with the contagion it venteth.&nbsp; Beside, nothing
is lasting that is feigned; it will have another face than it
had, ere long. <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; As Euripides saith, &ldquo;No lie
ever grows old.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Nullum vitium sine patrocinio</i>.&mdash;It is strange
there should be no vice without its patronage, that when we have
no other excuse we will say, we love it, we cannot forsake
it.&nbsp; As if that made it not more a fault.&nbsp; We cannot,
because we think we cannot, and we love it because we will defend
it.&nbsp; We will rather excuse it than be rid of it.&nbsp; That
we cannot is pretended; but that we will not is the true
reason.&nbsp; How many have I known that would not have their
vices hid? nay, and, to be noted, live like Antipodes to others
in the same city? never see the sun rise or set in so many years,
but be as they were watching a corpse by torch-light; would not
sin the common way, but held that a kind of rusticity; they would
do it new, or contrary, for the infamy; they were ambitious of
living backward; and at last arrived at that, as they would love
nothing but the vices, not the vicious customs.&nbsp; It was
impossible to reform these natures; they were dried and hardened
in their ill.&nbsp; They may say they desired to leave it, but do
not trust them; and they may think they desire it, but they may
lie for all that; they are a little angry with their follies now
and then; marry, they come into grace with them again
quickly.&nbsp; They will confess they are offended with their
manner of living like enough; who is not?&nbsp; When they can put
me in security that they are more than offended, that they hate
it, then I will hearken to them, and perhaps believe them; but
many now-a-days love and hate their ill together.</p>
<p><i>De vere argutis</i>.&mdash;I do hear them say often some
men are not witty, because they are not everywhere witty; than
which nothing is more foolish.&nbsp; If an eye or a nose be an
excellent part in the face, therefore be all eye or nose!&nbsp; I
think the eyebrow, the forehead, the cheek, chin, lip, or any
part else are as necessary and natural in the place.&nbsp; But
now nothing is good that is natural; right and natural language
seems to have least of the wit in it; that which is writhed and
tortured is counted the more exquisite.&nbsp; Cloth of bodkin or
tissue must be embroidered; as if no face were fair that were not
powdered or painted! no beauty to be had but in wresting and
writhing our own tongue!&nbsp; Nothing is fashionable till it be
deformed; and this is to write like a gentleman.&nbsp; All must
be affected and preposterous as our gallants&rsquo; clothes,
sweet-bags, and night-dressings, in which you would think our men
lay in, like ladies, it is so curious.</p>
<p><i>Censura de poetis</i>.&mdash;Nothing in our age, I have
observed, is more preposterous than the running judgments upon
poetry and poets; when we shall hear those things commended and
cried up for the best writings which a man would scarce vouchsafe
to wrap any wholesome drug in; he would never light his tobacco
with them.&nbsp; And those men almost named for miracles, who yet
are so vile that if a man should go about to examine and correct
them, he must make all they have done but one blot.&nbsp; Their
good is so entangled with their bad as forcibly one must draw on
the other&rsquo;s death with it.&nbsp; A sponge dipped in ink
will do all:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Non possunt . . . mult&aelig; . . .

<p><i>Cestius</i>&mdash;<i>Cicero</i>&mdash;<i>Heath</i>&mdash;<i>Taylor</i>&mdash;<i>Spenser</i>.&mdash;Yet
their vices have not hurt them; nay, a great many they have
profited, for they have been loved for nothing else.&nbsp; And
this false opinion grows strong against the best men, if once it
take root with the ignorant.&nbsp; Cestius, in his time, was
preferred to Cicero, so far as the ignorant durst.&nbsp; They
learned him without book, and had him often in their mouths; but
a man cannot imagine that thing so foolish or rude but will find
and enjoy an admirer; at least a reader or spectator.&nbsp; The
puppets are seen now in despite of the players; Heath&rsquo;s
epigrams and the Sculler&rsquo;s poems have their applause.&nbsp;
There are never wanting that dare prefer the worst preachers, the
worst pleaders, the worst poets; not that the better have left to
write or speak better, but that they that hear them judge worse;
<i>Non illi pejus dicunt</i>, <i>sed hi corruptius
judicant</i>.&nbsp; Nay, if it were put to the question of the
water-rhymer&rsquo;s works, against Spenser&rsquo;s, I doubt not
but they would find more suffrages; because the most favour
common vices, out of a prerogative the vulgar have to lose their
judgments and like that which is naught.</p>
<p>Poetry, in this latter age, hath proved but a mean mistress to
such as have wholly addicted themselves to her, or given their
names up to her family.&nbsp; They who have but saluted her on
the by, and now and then tendered their visits, she hath done
much for, and advanced in the way of their own professions (both
the law and the gospel) beyond all they could have hoped or done
for themselves without her favour.&nbsp; Wherein she doth emulate
the judicious but preposterous bounty of the time&rsquo;s
grandees, who accumulate all they can upon the parasite or
fresh-man in their friendship; but think an old client or honest
servant bound by his place to write and starve.</p>
<p>Indeed, the multitude commend writers as they do fencers or
wrestlers, who if they come in robustiously and put for it with a
deal of violence are received for the braver fellows; when many
times their own rudeness is a cause of their disgrace, and a
slight touch of their adversary gives all that boisterous force
the foil.&nbsp; But in these things the unskilful are naturally
deceived, and judging wholly by the bulk, think rude things
greater than polished, and scattered more numerous than composed;
nor think this only to be true in the sordid multitude, but the
neater sort of our gallants; for all are the multitude, only they
differ in clothes, not in judgment or understanding.</p>
<p><i>De Shakspeare nostrat</i>.&mdash;<i>Augustus in
Hat</i>.&mdash;I remember the players have often mentioned it as
an honour to Shakspeare, that in his writing (whatsoever he
penned) he never blotted out a line.&nbsp; My answer hath been,
&ldquo;Would he had blotted a thousand,&rdquo; which they thought
a malevolent speech.&nbsp; I had not told posterity this but for
their ignorance who chose that circumstance to commend their
friend by wherein he most faulted; and to justify mine own
candour, for I loved the man, and do honour his memory on this
side idolatry as much as any.&nbsp; He was, indeed, honest, and
of an open and free nature, had an excellent phantasy, brave
notions, and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that
facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be
stopped.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Sufflaminandus erat</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a"
class="citation">[47a]</a> as Augustus said of Haterius.&nbsp;
His wit was in his own power; would the rule of it had been so,
too.&nbsp; Many times he fell into those things, could not escape
laughter, as when he said in the person of C&aelig;sar, one
speaking to him, &ldquo;C&aelig;sar, thou dost me
wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;C&aelig;sar did never
wrong but with just cause;&rdquo; and such like, which were
ridiculous.&nbsp; But he redeemed his vices with his
virtues.&nbsp; There was ever more in him to be praised than to
be pardoned.</p>
<p><i>Ingeniorum discrimina</i>.&mdash;<i>Not.</i> 1.&mdash;In
the difference of wits I have observed there are many notes; and
it is a little maistry to know them, to discern what every
nature, every disposition will bear; for before we sow our land
we should plough it.&nbsp; There are no fewer forms of minds than
of bodies amongst us.&nbsp; The variety is incredible, and
therefore we must search.&nbsp; Some are fit to make divines,
some poets, some lawyers, some physicians; some to be sent to the
plough, and trades.</p>
<p>There is no doctrine will do good where nature is
wanting.&nbsp; Some wits are swelling and high; others low and
still; some hot and fiery; others cold and dull; one must have a
bridle, the other a spur.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i> 2.&mdash;There be some that are forward and bold;
and these will do every little thing easily.&nbsp; I mean that is
hard by and next them, which they will utter unretarded without
any shamefastness.&nbsp; These never perform much, but
quickly.&nbsp; They are what they are on the sudden; they show
presently, like grain that, scattered on the top of the ground,
shoots up, but takes no root; has a yellow blade, but the ear
empty.&nbsp; They are wits of good promise at first, but there is
an <i>ingenistitium</i>; <a name="citation49a"></a><a
href="#footnote49a" class="citation">[49a]</a> they stand still
at sixteen, they get no higher.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i> 3.&mdash;You have others that labour only to
ostentation; and are ever more busy about the colours and surface
of a work than in the matter and foundation, for that is hid, the
other is seen.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i> 4.&mdash;Others that in composition are nothing
but what is rough and broken.&nbsp; <i>Qu&aelig; per
salebras</i>, <i>altaque saxa cadunt</i>. <a
name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b"
class="citation">[49b]</a>&nbsp; And if it would come gently,
they trouble it of purpose.&nbsp; They would not have it run
without rubs, as if that style were more strong and manly that
struck the ear with a kind of unevenness.&nbsp; These men err not
by chance, but knowingly and willingly; they are like men that
affect a fashion by themselves; have some singularity in a ruff
cloak, or hat-band; or their beards specially cut to provoke
beholders, and set a mark upon themselves.&nbsp; They would be
reprehended while they are looked on.&nbsp; And this vice, one
that is authority with the rest, loving, delivers over to them to
be imitated; so that ofttimes the faults which be fell into the
others seek for.&nbsp; This is the danger, when vice becomes a
precedent.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i> 5.&mdash;Others there are that have no composition
at all; but a kind of tuning and rhyming fall in what they
write.&nbsp; It runs and slides, and only makes a sound.&nbsp;
Women&rsquo;s poets they are called, as you have women&rsquo;s
tailors.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;They write a verse as smooth, as soft as
cream,<br />
In which there is no torrent, nor scarce stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may sound these wits and find the depth of them with your
middle finger.&nbsp; They are cream-bowl or but puddle-deep.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i> 6.&mdash;Some that turn over all books, and are
equally searching in all papers; that write out of what they
presently find or meet, without choice.&nbsp; By which means it
happens that what they have discredited and impugned in one week,
they have before or after extolled the same in another.&nbsp;
Such are all the essayists, even their master Montaigne.&nbsp;
These, in all they write, confess still what books they have read
last, and therein their own folly so much, that they bring it to
the stake raw and undigested; not that the place did need it
neither, but that they thought themselves furnished and would
vent it.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i> 7.&mdash;Some, again who, after they have got
authority, or, which is less, opinion, by their writings, to have
read much, dare presently to feign whole books and authors, and
lie safely.&nbsp; For what never was, will not easily be found,
not by the most curious.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i> 8.&mdash;And some, by a cunning protestation
against all reading, and false venditation of their own naturals,
think to divert the sagacity of their readers from themselves,
and cool the scent of their own fox-like thefts; when yet they
are so rank, as a man may find whole pages together usurped from
one author; their necessities compelling them to read for present
use, which could not be in many books; and so come forth more
ridiculously and palpably guilty than those who, because they
cannot trace, they yet would slander their industry.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i> 9.&mdash;But the wretcheder are the obstinate
contemners of all helps and arts; such as presuming on their own
naturals (which, perhaps, are excellent), dare deride all
diligence, and seem to mock at the terms when they understand not
the things; thinking that way to get off wittily with their
ignorance.&nbsp; These are imitated often by such as are their
peers in negligence, though they cannot be in nature; and they
utter all they can think with a kind of violence and
indisposition, unexamined, without relation either to person,
place, or any fitness else; and the more wilful and stubborn they
are in it the more learned they are esteemed of the multitude,
through their excellent vice of judgment, who think those things
the stronger that have no art; as if to break were better than to
open, or to rend asunder gentler than to loose.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i> 10.&mdash;It cannot but come to pass that these
men who commonly seek to do more than enough may sometimes happen
on something that is good and great; but very seldom: and when it
comes it doth not recompense the rest of their ill.&nbsp; For
their jests, and their sentences (which they only and ambitiously
seek for) stick out, and are more eminent, because all is sordid
and vile about them; as lights are more discerned in a thick
darkness than a faint shadow.&nbsp; Now, because they speak all
they can (however unfitly), they are thought to have the greater
copy; where the learned use ever election and a mean, they look
back to what they intended at first, and make all an even and
proportioned body.&nbsp; The true artificer will not run away
from Nature as he were afraid of her, or depart from life and the
likeness of truth, but speak to the capacity of his
hearers.&nbsp; And though his language differ from the vulgar
somewhat, it shall not fly from all humanity, with the Tamerlanes
and Tamer-chains of the late age, which had nothing in them but
the scenical strutting and furious vociferation to warrant them
to the ignorant gapers.&nbsp; He knows it is his only art so to
carry it, as none but artificers perceive it.&nbsp; In the
meantime, perhaps, he is called barren, dull, lean, a poor
writer, or by what contumelious word can come in their cheeks, by
these men who, without labour, judgment, knowledge, or almost
sense, are received or preferred before him.&nbsp; He gratulates
them and their fortune.&nbsp; Another age, or juster men, will
acknowledge the virtues of his studies, his wisdom in dividing,
his subtlety in arguing, with what strength he doth inspire his
readers, with what sweetness he strokes them; in inveighing, what
sharpness; in jest, what urbanity he uses; how he doth reign in
men&rsquo;s affections; how invade and break in upon them, and
makes their minds like the thing he writes.&nbsp; Then in his
elocution to behold what word is proper, which hath ornaments,
which height, what is beautifully translated, where figures are
fit, which gentle, which strong, to show the composition manly;
and how he hath avoided faint, obscure, obscene, sordid, humble,
improper, or effeminate phrase; which is not only praised of the
most, but commended (which is worse), especially for that it is
naught.</p>
<p><i>Ignorantia anim&aelig;</i>.&mdash;I know no disease of the
soul but ignorance, not of the arts and sciences, but of itself;
yet relating to those it is a pernicious evil, the darkener of
man&rsquo;s life, the disturber of his reason, and common
confounder of truth, with which a man goes groping in the dark,
no otherwise than if he were blind.&nbsp; Great understandings
are most racked and troubled with it; nay, sometimes they will
rather choose to die than not to know the things they study
for.&nbsp; Think, then, what an evil it is, and what good the
contrary.</p>
<p><i>Scientia</i>.&mdash;Knowledge is the action of the soul and
is perfect without the senses, as having the seeds of all science
and virtue in itself; but not without the service of the senses;
by these organs the soul works: she is a perpetual agent, prompt
and subtle; but often flexible and erring, entangling herself
like a silkworm, but her reason is a weapon with two edges, and
cuts through.&nbsp; In her indagations oft-times new scents put
her by, and she takes in errors into her by the same conduits she
doth truths.</p>
<p><i>Otium Studiorum</i>.&mdash;Ease and relaxation are
profitable to all studies.&nbsp; The mind is like a bow, the
stronger by being unbent.&nbsp; But the temper in spirits is all,
when to command a man&rsquo;s wit, when to favour it.&nbsp; I
have known a man vehement on both sides, that knew no mean,
either to intermit his studies or call upon them again.&nbsp;
When he hath set himself to writing he would join night to day,
press upon himself without release, not minding it, till he
fainted; and when he left off, resolve himself into all sports
and looseness again, that it was almost a despair to draw him to
his book; but once got to it, he grew stronger and more earnest
by the ease.&nbsp; His whole powers were renewed; he would work
out of himself what he desired, but with such excess as his study
could not be ruled; he knew not how to dispose his own abilities,
or husband them; he was of that immoderate power against
himself.&nbsp; Nor was he only a strong, but an absolute speaker
and writer; but his subtlety did not show itself; his judgment
thought that a vice; for the ambush hurts more that is hid.&nbsp;
He never forced his language, nor went out of the highway of
speaking but for some great necessity or apparent profit; for he
denied figures to be invented for ornament, but for aid; and
still thought it an extreme madness to bind or wrest that which
ought to be right.</p>
<p><i>Stili
eminentia</i>.&mdash;<i>Virgil</i>.&mdash;<i>Tully</i>.&mdash;<i>Sallust</i>.&mdash;It
is no wonder men&rsquo;s eminence appears but in their own
way.&nbsp; Virgil&rsquo;s felicity left him in prose, as
Tully&rsquo;s forsook him in verse.&nbsp; Sallust&rsquo;s
orations are read in the honour of story, yet the most
eloquent.&nbsp; Plato&rsquo;s speech, which he made for Socrates,
is neither worthy of the patron nor the person defended.&nbsp;
Nay, in the same kind of oratory, and where the matter is one,
you shall have him that reasons strongly, open negligently;
another that prepares well, not fit so well.&nbsp; And this
happens not only to brains, but to bodies.&nbsp; One can wrestle
well, another run well, a third leap or throw the bar, a fourth
lift or stop a cart going; each hath his way of strength.&nbsp;
So in other creatures&mdash;some dogs are for the deer, some for
the wild boar, some are fox-hounds, some otter-hounds.&nbsp; Nor
are all horses for the coach or saddle, some are for the cart and
paniers.</p>
<p><i>De Claris Oratoribus</i>.&mdash;I have known many excellent
men that would speak suddenly to the admiration of their hearers,
who upon study and premeditation have been forsaken by their own
wits, and no way answered their fame; their eloquence was greater
than their reading, and the things they uttered better than those
they knew; their fortune deserved better of them than their
care.&nbsp; For men of present spirits, and of greater wits than
study, do please more in the things they invent than in those
they bring.&nbsp; And I have heard some of them compelled to
speak, out of necessity, that have so infinitely exceeded
themselves, as it was better both for them and their auditory
that they were so surprised, not prepared.&nbsp; Nor was it safe
then to cross them, for their adversary, their anger made them
more eloquent.&nbsp; Yet these men I could not but love and
admire, that they returned to their studies.&nbsp; They left not
diligence (as many do) when their rashness prospered; for
diligence is a great aid, even to an indifferent wit; when we are
not contented with the examples of our own age, but would know
the face of the former.&nbsp; Indeed, the more we confer with the
more we profit by, if the persons be chosen.</p>
<p><i>Dominus Verulamius</i>.&mdash;One, though he be excellent
and the chief, is not to be imitated alone; for no imitator ever
grew up to his author; likeness is always on this side
truth.&nbsp; Yet there happened in my time one noble speaker who
was full of gravity in his speaking; his language (where he could
spare or pass by a jest) was nobly censorious.&nbsp; No man ever
spake more neatly, more pressly, more weightily, or suffered less
emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered.&nbsp; No member of
his speech but consisted of his own graces.&nbsp; His hearers
could not cough, or look aside from him, without loss.&nbsp; He
commanded where he spoke, and had his judges angry and pleased at
his devotion.&nbsp; No man had their affections more in his
power.&nbsp; The fear of every man that heard him was lest he
should make an end.</p>
<p><i>Scriptorum catalogus</i>. <a name="citation59a"></a><a
href="#footnote59a" class="citation">[59a]</a>&nbsp; Cicero is
said to be the only wit that the people of Rome had equalled to
their empire.&nbsp; <i>Ingenium par imperio</i>.&nbsp; We have
had many, and in their several ages (to take in but the former
<i>seculum</i>) Sir Thomas More, the elder Wiat, Henry Earl of
Surrey, Chaloner, Smith, Eliot, B. Gardiner, were for their times
admirable; and the more, because they began eloquence with
us.&nbsp; Sir Nicolas Bacon was singular, and almost alone, in
the beginning of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Sir Philip
Sidney and Mr. Hooker (in different matter) grew great masters of
wit and language, and in whom all vigour of invention and
strength of judgment met.&nbsp; The Earl of Essex, noble and
high; and Sir Walter Raleigh, not to be contemned, either for
judgment or style.&nbsp; Sir Henry Savile, grave, and truly
lettered; Sir Edwin Sandys, excellent in both; Lord Egerton, the
Chancellor, a grave and great orator, and best when he was
provoked; but his learned and able (though unfortunate) successor
is he who hath filled up all numbers, and performed that in our
tongue which may be compared or preferred either to insolent
Greece or haughty Rome.&nbsp; In short, within his view, and
about his times, were all the wits born that could honour a
language or help study.&nbsp; Now things daily fall, wits grow
downward, and eloquence grows backward; so that he may be named
and stand as the mark and &alpha;&kappa;&mu;&eta; of our
language.</p>
<p><i>De augmentis scientiarum</i>.&mdash;<i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i>.&mdash;<i>Lord St. Alban</i>.&mdash;I have ever
observed it to have been the office of a wise patriot, among the
greatest affairs of the State, to take care of the commonwealth
of learning.&nbsp; For schools, they are the seminaries of State;
and nothing is worthier the study of a statesman than that part
of the republic which we call the advancement of letters.&nbsp;
Witness the care of Julius C&aelig;sar, who, in the heat of the
civil war, writ his books of Analogy, and dedicated them to
Tully.&nbsp; This made the late Lord St. Alban entitle his work
<i>Novum Organum</i>; which, though by the most of superficial
men, who cannot get beyond the title of nominals, it is not
penetrated nor understood, it really openeth all defects of
learning whatsoever, and is a book</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Qui longum note scriptori proroget
&aelig;vum.&rdquo; <a name="citation62a"></a><a
href="#footnote62a" class="citation">[62a]</a></p>
<p>My conceit of his person was never increased toward him by his
place or honours; but I have and do reverence him for the
greatness that was only proper to himself, in that he seemed to
me ever, by his work, one of the greatest men, and most worthy of
admiration, that had been in many ages.&nbsp; In his adversity I
ever prayed that God would give him strength; for greatness he
could not want.&nbsp; Neither could I condole in a word or
syllable for him, as knowing no accident could do harm to virtue,
but rather help to make it manifest.</p>
<p><i>De corruptela morum</i>.&mdash;There cannot be one colour
of the mind, another of the wit.&nbsp; If the mind be staid,
grave, and composed, the wit is so; that vitiated, the other is
blown and deflowered.&nbsp; Do we not see, if the mind languish,
the members are dull?&nbsp; Look upon an effeminate person, his
very gait confesseth him.&nbsp; If a man be fiery, his motion is
so; if angry, it is troubled and violent.&nbsp; So that we may
conclude wheresoever manners and fashions are corrupted, language
is.&nbsp; It imitates the public riot.&nbsp; The excess of feasts
and apparel are the notes of a sick state, and the wantonness of
language of a sick mind.</p>
<p><i>De rebus mundanis</i>.&mdash;If we would consider what our
affairs are indeed, not what they are called, we should find more
evils belonging to us than happen to us.&nbsp; How often doth
that which was called a calamity prove the beginning and cause of
a man&rsquo;s happiness? and, on the contrary, that which
happened or came to another with great gratulation and applause,
how it hath lifted him but a step higher to his ruin? as if he
stood before where he might fall safely.</p>
<p><i>Vulgi mores</i>.&mdash;<i>Morbus comitialis</i>.&mdash;The
vulgar are commonly ill-natured, and always grudging against
their governors: which makes that a prince has more business and
trouble with them than ever Hercules had with the bull or any
other beast; by how much they have more heads than will be reined
with one bridle.&nbsp; There was not that variety of beasts in
the ark, as is of beastly natures in the multitude; especially
when they come to that iniquity to censure their
sovereign&rsquo;s actions.&nbsp; Then all the counsels are made
good or bad by the events; and it falleth out that the same facts
receive from them the names, now of diligence, now of vanity, now
of majesty, now of fury; where they ought wholly to hang on his
mouth, as he to consist of himself, and not others&rsquo;
counsels.</p>
<p><i>Princeps</i>.&mdash;After God, nothing is to be loved of
man like the prince; he violates Nature that doth it not with his
whole heart.&nbsp; For when he hath put on the care of the public
good and common safety, I am a wretch, and put off man, if I do
not reverence and honour him, in whose charge all things divine
and human are placed.&nbsp; Do but ask of Nature why all living
creatures are less delighted with meat and drink that sustains
them than with venery that wastes them? and she will tell thee,
the first respects but a private, the other a common good,
propagation.</p>
<p><i>De eodem</i>.&mdash;<i>Orpheus&rsquo; Hymn</i>.&mdash;He is
the arbiter of life and death: when he finds no other subject for
his mercy, he should spare himself.&nbsp; All his punishments are
rather to correct than to destroy.&nbsp; Why are prayers with
Orpheus said to be the daughters of Jupiter, but that princes are
thereby admonished that the petitions of the wretched ought to
have more weight with them than the laws themselves.</p>
<p><i>De opt. Rege Jacobo</i>.&mdash;It was a great accumulation
to His Majesty&rsquo;s deserved praise that men might openly
visit and pity those whom his greatest prisons had at any time
received or his laws condemned.</p>
<p><i>De Princ. adjunctis</i>.&mdash;<i>Sed ver&egrave; prudens
haud concipi possit Princeps</i>, <i>nisi simul et
bonus</i>.&mdash;<i>Lycurgus</i>.&mdash;<i>Sylla</i>.&mdash;<i>Lysander</i>.&mdash;<i>Cyrus</i>.&mdash;Wise
is rather the attribute of a prince than learned or good.&nbsp;
The learned man profits others rather than himself; the good man
rather himself than others; but the prince commands others, and
doth himself.</p>
<p>The wise Lycurgus gave no law but what himself kept.&nbsp;
Sylla and Lysander did not so; the one living extremely dissolute
himself, enforced frugality by the laws; the other permitted
those licenses to others which himself abstained from.&nbsp; But
the prince&rsquo;s prudence is his chief art and safety.&nbsp; In
his counsels and deliberations he foresees the future times: in
the equity of his judgment he hath remembrance of the past, and
knowledge of what is to be done or avoided for the present.&nbsp;
Hence the Persians gave out their Cyrus to have been nursed by a
bitch, a creature to encounter it, as of sagacity to seek out
good; showing that wisdom may accompany fortitude, or it leaves
to be, and puts on the name of rashness.</p>
<p><i>De malign. studentium</i>.&mdash;There be some men are born
only to suck out the poison of books: <i>Habent venenum pro
victu</i>; <i>im&ocirc;</i>, <i>pro deliciis</i>. <a
name="citation66a"></a><a href="#footnote66a"
class="citation">[66a]</a>&nbsp; And such are they that only
relish the obscene and foul things in poets, which makes the
profession taxed.&nbsp; But by whom?&nbsp; Men that watch for it;
and, had they not had this hint, are so unjust valuers of letters
as they think no learning good but what brings in gain.&nbsp; It
shows they themselves would never have been of the professions
they are but for the profits and fees.&nbsp; But if another
learning, well used, can instruct to good life, inform manners,
no less persuade and lead men than they threaten and compel, and
have no reward, is it therefore the worst study?&nbsp; I could
never think the study of wisdom confined only to the philosopher,
or of piety to the divine, or of state to the politic; but that
he which can feign a commonwealth (which is the poet) can govern
it with counsels, strengthen it with laws, correct it with
judgments, inform it with religion and morals, is all
these.&nbsp; We do not require in him mere elocution, or an
excellent faculty in verse, but the exact knowledge of all
virtues and their contraries, with ability to render the one
loved, the other hated, by his proper embattling them.&nbsp; The
philosophers did insolently, to challenge only to themselves that
which the greatest generals and gravest counsellors never
durst.&nbsp; For such had rather do than promise the best
things.</p>
<p><i>Controvers. scriptores</i>.&mdash;<i>More Andabatarum qui
clausis oculis pugnant</i>.&mdash;Some controverters in divinity
are like swaggerers in a tavern that catch that which stands next
them, the candlestick or pots; turn everything into a weapon:
ofttimes they fight blindfold, and both beat the air.&nbsp; The
one milks a he-goat, the other holds under a sieve.&nbsp; Their
arguments are as fluxive as liquor spilt upon a table, which with
your finger you may drain as you will.&nbsp; Such controversies
or disputations (carried with more labour than profit) are
odious; where most times the truth is lost in the midst or left
untouched.&nbsp; And the fruit of their fight is, that they spit
one upon another, and are both defiled.&nbsp; These fencers in
religion I like not.</p>
<p><i>Morbi</i>.&mdash;The body hath certain diseases that are
with less evil tolerated than removed.&nbsp; As if to cure a
leprosy a man should bathe himself with the warm blood of a
murdered child, so in the Church some errors may be dissimuled
with less inconvenience than they can be discovered.</p>
<p><i>Jactantia intempestiva</i>.&mdash;Men that talk of their
own benefits are not believed to talk of them because they have
done them; but to have done them because they might talk of
them.&nbsp; That which had been great, if another had reported it
of them, vanisheth, and is nothing, if he that did it speak of
it.&nbsp; For men, when they cannot destroy the deed, will yet be
glad to take advantage of the boasting, and lessen it.</p>
<p><i>Adulatio</i>.&mdash;I have seen that poverty makes me do
unfit things; but honest men should not do them; they should gain
otherwise.&nbsp; Though a man be hungry, he should not play the
parasite.&nbsp; That hour wherein I would repent me to be honest,
there were ways enough open for me to be rich.&nbsp; But flattery
is a fine pick-lock of tender ears; especially of those whom
fortune hath borne high upon their wings, that submit their
dignity and authority to it, by a soothing of themselves.&nbsp;
For, indeed, men could never be taken in that abundance with the
springes of others&rsquo; flattery, if they began not there; if
they did but remember how much more profitable the bitterness of
truth were, than all the honey distilling from a whorish voice,
which is not praise, but poison.&nbsp; But now it is come to that
extreme folly, or rather madness, with some, that he that
flatters them modestly or sparingly is thought to malign
them.&nbsp; If their friend consent not to their vices, though he
do not contradict them, he is nevertheless an enemy.&nbsp; When
they do all things the worst way, even then they look for
praise.&nbsp; Nay, they will hire fellows to flatter them with
suits and suppers, and to prostitute their judgments.&nbsp; They
have livery-friends, friends of the dish, and of the spit, that
wait their turns, as my lord has his feasts and guests.</p>
<p><i>De vit&acirc; human&acirc;</i>.&mdash;I have considered our
whole life is like a play: wherein every man forgetful of
himself, is in travail with expression of another.&nbsp; Nay, we
so insist in imitating others, as we cannot when it is necessary
return to ourselves; like children, that imitate the vices of
stammerers so long, till at last they become such; and make the
habit to another nature, as it is never forgotten.</p>
<p><i>De piis et probis</i>.&mdash;Good men are the stars, the
planets of the ages wherein they live and illustrate the
times.&nbsp; God did never let them be wanting to the world: as
Abel, for an example of innocency, Enoch of purity, Noah of trust
in God&rsquo;s mercies, Abraham of faith, and so of the
rest.&nbsp; These, sensual men thought mad because they would not
be partakers or practisers of their madness.&nbsp; But they,
placed high on the top of all virtue, looked down on the stage of
the world and contemned the play of fortune.&nbsp; For though the
most be players, some must be spectators.</p>
<p><i>Mores aulici</i>.&mdash;I have discovered that a feigned
familiarity in great ones is a note of certain usurpation on the
less.&nbsp; For great and popular men feign themselves to be
servants to others to make those slaves to them.&nbsp; So the
fisher provides bait for the trout, roach, dace, &amp;c., that
they may be food to him.</p>
<p><i>Impiorum
querela</i>.&mdash;<i>Augusties</i>.&mdash;<i>Varus</i>.&mdash;<i>Tiberius</i>.&mdash;The
complaint of Caligula was most wicked of the condition of his
times, when he said they were not famous for any public calamity,
as the reign of Augustus was, by the defeat of Varus and the
legions; and that of Tiberius, by the falling of the theatre at
Fiden&aelig;; whilst his oblivion was eminent through the
prosperity of his affairs.&nbsp; As that other voice of his was
worthier a headsman than a head when he wished the people of Rome
had but one neck.&nbsp; But he found when he fell they had many
hands.&nbsp; A tyrant, how great and mighty soever he may seem to
cowards and sluggards, is but one creature, one animal.</p>
<p><i>Nobilium ingenia</i>.&mdash;I have marked among the
nobility some are so addicted to the service of the prince and
commonwealth, as they look not for spoil; such are to be honoured
and loved.&nbsp; There are others which no obligation will fasten
on; and they are of two sorts.&nbsp; The first are such as love
their own ease; or, out of vice, of nature, or self-direction,
avoid business and care.&nbsp; Yet these the prince may use with
safety.&nbsp; The other remove themselves upon craft and design,
as the architects say, with a premeditated thought, to their own
rather than their prince&rsquo;s profit.&nbsp; Such let the
prince take heed of, and not doubt to reckon in the list of his
open enemies.</p>
<p><i>Principum. varia</i>.&mdash;<i>Firmissima ver&ograve;
omnium basis jus h&aelig;reditarium Principis</i>.&mdash;There is
a great variation between him that is raised to the sovereignty
by the favour of his peers and him that comes to it by the
suffrage of the people.&nbsp; The first holds with more
difficulty, because he hath to do with many that think themselves
his equals, and raised him for their own greatness and oppression
of the rest.&nbsp; The latter hath no upbraiders, but was raised
by them that sought to be defended from oppression: whose end is
both easier and the honester to satisfy.&nbsp; Beside, while he
hath the people to friend, who are a multitude, he hath the less
fear of the nobility, who are but few.&nbsp; Nor let the common
proverb (of he that builds on the people builds on the dirt)
discredit my opinion: for that hath only place where an ambitious
and private person, for some popular end, trusts in them against
the public justice and magistrate.&nbsp; There they will leave
him.&nbsp; But when a prince governs them, so as they have still
need of his administrations (for that is his art), he shall ever
make and hold them faithful.</p>
<p><i>Clementia</i>.&mdash;<i>Machiavell</i>.&mdash;A prince
should exercise his cruelty not by himself but by his ministers;
so he may save himself and his dignity with his people by
sacrificing those when he list, saith the great doctor of state,
Machiavell.&nbsp; But I say he puts off man and goes into a
beast, that is cruel.&nbsp; No virtue is a prince&rsquo;s own, or
becomes him more, than this clemency: and no glory is greater
than to be able to save with his power.&nbsp; Many punishments
sometimes, and in some cases, as much discredit a prince, as many
funerals a physician.&nbsp; The state of things is secured by
clemency; severity represseth a few, but irritates more. <a
name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a"
class="citation">[74a]</a>&nbsp; The lopping of trees makes the
boughs shoot out thicker; and the taking away of some kind of
enemies increaseth the number.&nbsp; It is then most gracious in
a prince to pardon when many about him would make him cruel; to
think then how much he can save when others tell him how much he
can destroy; not to consider what the impotence of others hath
demolished, but what his own greatness can sustain.&nbsp; These
are a prince&rsquo;s virtues: and they that give him other
counsels are but the hangman&rsquo;s factors.</p>
<p><i>Clementia tutela optima</i>.&mdash;He that is cruel to
halves (saith the said St. Nicholas <a name="citation74b"></a><a
href="#footnote74b" class="citation">[74b]</a>) loseth no less
the opportunity of his cruelty than of his benefits: for then to
use his cruelty is too late; and to use his favours will be
interpreted fear and necessity, and so he loseth the
thanks.&nbsp; Still the counsel is cruelty.&nbsp; But princes, by
hearkening to cruel counsels, become in time obnoxious to the
authors, their flatterers, and ministers; and are brought to
that, that when they would, they dare not change them; they must
go on and defend cruelty with cruelty; they cannot alter the
habit.&nbsp; It is then grown necessary, they must be as ill as
those have made them: and in the end they will grow more hateful
to themselves than to their subjects.&nbsp; Whereas, on the
contrary, the merciful prince is safe in love, not in fear.&nbsp;
He needs no emissaries, spies, intelligencers to entrap true
subjects.&nbsp; He fears no libels, no treasons.&nbsp; His people
speak what they think, and talk openly what they do in
secret.&nbsp; They have nothing in their breasts that they need a
cypher for.&nbsp; He is guarded with his own benefits.</p>
<p><i>Religio</i>.&nbsp; <i>Palladium
Homeri</i>.&mdash;<i>Euripides</i>.&mdash;The strength of empire
is in religion.&nbsp; What else is the Palladium (with Homer)
that kept Troy so long from sacking?&nbsp; Nothing more commends
the Sovereign to the subject than it.&nbsp; For he that is
religious must be merciful and just necessarily: and they are two
strong ties upon mankind.&nbsp; Justice the virtue that innocence
rejoiceth in.&nbsp; Yet even that is not always so safe, but it
may love to stand in the sight of mercy.&nbsp; For sometimes
misfortune is made a crime, and then innocence is succoured no
less than virtue.&nbsp; Nay, oftentimes virtue is made capital;
and through the condition of the times it may happen that that
may be punished with our praise.&nbsp; Let no man therefore
murmur at the actions of the prince, who is placed so far above
him.&nbsp; If he offend, he hath his discoverer.&nbsp; God hath a
height beyond him.&nbsp; But where the prince is good, Euripides
saith, &ldquo;God is a guest in a human body.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Tyranni</i>.&mdash;<i>Sejanus</i>.&mdash;There is nothing
with some princes sacred above their majesty, or profane, but
what violates their sceptres.&nbsp; But a prince, with such a
council, is like the god Terminus, of stone, his own landmark, or
(as it is in the fable) a crowned lion.&nbsp; It is dangerous
offending such a one, who, being angry, knows not how to forgive;
that cares not to do anything for maintaining or enlarging of
empire; kills not men or subjects, but destroyeth whole
countries, armies, mankind, male and female, guilty or not
guilty, holy or profane; yea, some that have not seen the
light.&nbsp; All is under the law of their spoil and
licence.&nbsp; But princes that neglect their proper office thus
their fortune is oftentimes to draw a Sejanus to be near about
them, who at last affect to get above them, and put them in a
worthy fear of rooting both them out and their family.&nbsp; For
no men hate an evil prince more than they that helped to make him
such.&nbsp; And none more boastingly weep his ruin than they that
procured and practised it.&nbsp; The same path leads to ruin
which did to rule when men profess a licence in government.&nbsp;
A good king is a public servant.</p>
<p><i>Illiteratus princeps</i>.&mdash;A prince without letters is
a pilot without eyes.&nbsp; All his government is groping.&nbsp;
In sovereignty it is a most happy thing not to be compelled; but
so it is the most miserable not to be counselled.&nbsp; And how
can he be counselled that cannot see to read the best counsellors
(which are books), for they neither flatter us nor hide from
us?&nbsp; He may hear, you will say; but how shall he always be
sure to hear truth, or be counselled the best things, not the
sweetest?&nbsp; They say princes learn no art truly but the art
of horsemanship.&nbsp; The reason is the brave beast is no
flatterer.&nbsp; He will throw a prince as soon as his
groom.&nbsp; Which is an argument that the good counsellors to
princes are the best instruments of a good age.&nbsp; For though
the prince himself be of a most prompt inclination to all virtue,
yet the best pilots have needs of mariners besides sails, anchor,
and other tackle.</p>
<p><i>Character principis</i>.&mdash;<i>Alexander
magnus</i>.&mdash;If men did know what shining fetters, gilded
miseries, and painted happiness thrones and sceptres were there
would not be so frequent strife about the getting or holding of
them; there would be more principalities than princes; for a
prince is the pastor of the people.&nbsp; He ought to shear, not
to flay his sheep; to take their fleeces, not their the soul of
the commonwealth, and ought to cherish it as his own body.&nbsp;
Alexander the Great was wont to say, &ldquo;He hated that
gardener that plucked his herbs or flowers up by the
roots.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man may milk a beast till the blood come;
churn milk and it yieldeth butter, but wring the nose and the
blood followeth.&nbsp; He is an ill prince that so pulls his
subjects&rsquo; feathers as he would not have them grow again;
that makes his exchequer a receipt for the spoils of those he
governs.&nbsp; No, let him keep his own, not affect his
subjects&rsquo;; strive rather to be called just than
powerful.&nbsp; Not, like the Roman tyrants, affect the surnames
that grow by human slaughters; neither to seek war in peace, nor
peace in war, but to observe faith given, though to an
enemy.&nbsp; Study piety toward the subject; show care to defend
him.&nbsp; Be slow to punish in divers cases, but be a sharp and
severe revenger of open crimes.&nbsp; Break no decrees or
dissolve no orders to slacken the strength of laws.&nbsp; Choose
neither magistrates, civil or ecclesiastical, by favour or price;
but with long disquisition and report of their worth by all
suffrages.&nbsp; Sell no honours, nor give them hastily, but
bestow them with counsel and for reward; if he do, acknowledge it
(though late), and mend it.&nbsp; For princes are easy to be
deceived; and what wisdom can escape where so many court-arts are
studied?&nbsp; But, above all, the prince is to remember that
when the great day of account comes, which neither magistrate nor
prince can shun, there will be required of him a reckoning for
those whom he hath trusted, as for himself, which he must
provide.&nbsp; And if piety be wanting in the priests, equity in
the judges, or the magistrates be found rated at a price, what
justice or religion is to be expected? which are the only two
attributes make kings akin to God, and is the Delphic sword, both
to kill sacrifices and to chastise offenders.</p>
<p><i>De gratiosis</i>.&mdash;When a virtuous man is raised, it
brings gladness to his friends, grief to his enemies, and glory
to his posterity.&nbsp; Nay, his honours are a great part of the
honour of the times; when by this means he is grown to active men
an example, to the slothful a spur, to the envious a
punishment.</p>
<p><i>Divites</i>.&mdash;<i>Heredes ex asse</i>.&nbsp; He which
is sole heir to many rich men, having (besides his father&rsquo;s
and uncle&rsquo;s) the estates of divers his kindred come to him
by accession, must needs be richer than father or grandfather; so
they which are left heirs <i>ex asse</i> of all their
ancestors&rsquo; vices, and by their good husbandry improve the
old and daily purchase new, must needs be wealthier in vice, and
have a greater revenue or stock of ill to spend on.</p>
<p><i>Fures publici</i>.&mdash;The great thieves of a state are
lightly the officers of the crown; they hang the less still, play
the pikes in the pond, eat whom they list.&nbsp; The net was
never spread for the hawk or buzzard that hurt us, but the
harmless birds; they are good meat:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lewis XI</i>.&mdash;But they are not always safe though,
especially when they meet with wise masters.&nbsp; They can take
down all the huff and swelling of their looks, and like dexterous
auditors place the counter where he shall value nothing.&nbsp;
Let them but remember Lewis XI., who to a Clerk of the Exchequer
that came to be Lord Treasurer, and had (for his device)
represented himself sitting on fortune&rsquo;s wheel, told him he
might do well to fasten it with a good strong nail, lest, turning
about, it might bring him where he was again.&nbsp; As indeed it
did.</p>
<p><i>De bonis et malis</i>.&mdash;<i>De
innocenti&acirc;</i>.&mdash;A good man will avoid the spot of any
sin.&nbsp; The very aspersion is grievous, which makes him choose
his way in his life as he would in his journey.&nbsp; The ill man
rides through all confidently; he is coated and booted for
it.&nbsp; The oftener he offends, the more openly, and the
fouler, the fitter in fashion.&nbsp; His modesty, like a
riding-coat, the more it is worn is the less cared for.&nbsp; It
is good enough for the dirt still, and the ways he travels
in.&nbsp; An innocent man needs no eloquence, his innocence is
instead of it, else I had never come off so many times from these
precipices, whither men&rsquo;s malice hath pursued me.&nbsp; It
is true I have been accused to the lords, to the king, and by
great ones, but it happened my accusers had not thought of the
accusation with themselves, and so were driven, for want of
crimes, to use invention, which was found slander, or too late
(being entered so fair) to seek starting-holes for their
rashness, which were not given them.&nbsp; And then they may
think what accusation that was like to prove, when they that were
the engineers feared to be the authors.&nbsp; Nor were they
content to feign things against me, but to urge things, feigned
by the ignorant, against my profession, which though, from their
hired and mercenary impudence, I might have passed by as granted
to a nation of barkers that let out their tongues to lick
others&rsquo; sores; yet I durst not leave myself undefended,
having a pair of ears unskilful to hear lies, or have those
things said of me which I could truly prove of them.&nbsp; They
objected making of verses to me, when I could object to most of
them, their not being able to read them, but as worthy of
scorn.&nbsp; Nay, they would offer to urge mine own writings
against me, but by pieces (which was an excellent way of malice),
as if any man&rsquo;s context might not seem dangerous and
offensive, if that which was knit to what went before were
defrauded of his beginning; or that things by themselves uttered
might not seem subject to calumny, which read entire would appear
most free.&nbsp; At last they upbraided my poverty: I confess she
is my domestic; sober of diet, simple of habit, frugal, painful,
a good counseller to me, that keeps me from cruelty, pride, or
other more delicate impertinences, which are the nurse-children
of riches.&nbsp; But let them look over all the great and
monstrous wickednesses, they shall never find those in poor
families.&nbsp; They are the issue of the wealthy giants and the
mighty hunters, whereas no great work, or worthy of praise or
memory, but came out of poor cradles.&nbsp; It was the ancient
poverty that founded commonweals, built cities, invented arts,
made wholesome laws, armed men against vices, rewarded them with
their own virtues, and preserved the honour and state of nations,
till they betrayed themselves to riches.</p>
<p><i>Amor nummi</i>.&mdash;Money never made any man rich, but
his mind.&nbsp; He that can order himself to the law of Nature is
not only without the sense but the fear of poverty.&nbsp; O! but
to strike blind the people with our wealth and pomp is the
thing!&nbsp; What a wretchedness is this, to thrust all our
riches outward, and be beggars within; to contemplate nothing but
the little, vile, and sordid things of the world; not the great,
noble, and precious!&nbsp; We serve our avarice, and, not content
with the good of the earth that is offered us, we search and dig
for the evil that is hidden.&nbsp; God offered us those things,
and placed them at hand, and near us, that He knew were
profitable for us, but the hurtful He laid deep and hid.&nbsp;
Yet do we seek only the things whereby we may perish, and bring
them forth, when God and Nature hath buried them.&nbsp; We covet
superfluous things, when it were more honour for us if we would
contemn necessary.&nbsp; What need hath Nature of silver dishes,
multitudes of waiters, delicate pages, perfumed napkins?&nbsp;
She requires meat only, and hunger is not ambitious.&nbsp; Can we
think no wealth enough but such a state for which a man may be
brought into a premunire, begged, proscribed, or poisoned?&nbsp;
O! if a man could restrain the fury of his gullet and groin, and
think how many fires, how many kitchens, cooks, pastures, and
ploughed lands; what orchards, stews, ponds and parks, coops and
garners, he could spare; what velvets, tissues, embroideries,
laces, he could lack; and then how short and uncertain his life
is; he were in a better way to happiness than to live the emperor
of these delights, and be the dictator of fashions; but we make
ourselves slaves to our pleasures, and we serve fame and
ambition, which is an equal slavery.&nbsp; Have not I seen the
pomp of a whole kingdom, and what a foreign king could bring
hither?&nbsp; Also to make himself gazed and wondered
at&mdash;laid forth, as it were, to the show&mdash;and vanish all
away in a day?&nbsp; And shall that which could not fill the
expectation of few hours, entertain and take up our whole lives,
when even it appeared as superfluous to the possessors as to me
that was a spectator?&nbsp; The bravery was shown, it was not
possessed; while it boasted itself it perished.&nbsp; It is vile,
and a poor thing to place our happiness on these desires.&nbsp;
Say we wanted them all.&nbsp; Famine ends famine.</p>
<p><i>De mollibus et eff&oelig;minatis</i>.&mdash;There is
nothing valiant or solid to be hoped for from such as are always
kempt and perfumed, and every day smell of the tailor; the
exceedingly curious that are wholly in mending such an
imperfection in the face, in taking away the morphew in the neck,
or bleaching their hands at midnight, gumming and bridling their
beards, or making the waist small, binding it with hoops, while
the mind runs at waste; too much pickedness is not manly.&nbsp;
Not from those that will jest at their own outward imperfections,
but hide their ulcers within, their pride, lust, envy,
ill-nature, with all the art and authority they can.&nbsp; These
persons are in danger, for whilst they think to justify their
ignorance by impudence, and their persons by clothes and outward
ornaments, they use but a commission to deceive themselves:
where, if we will look with our understanding, and not our
senses, we may behold virtue and beauty (though covered with
rags) in their brightness; and vice and deformity so much the
fouler, in having all the splendour of riches to gild them, or
the false light of honour and power to help them.&nbsp; Yet this
is that wherewith the world is taken, and runs mad to gaze
on&mdash;clothes and titles, the birdlime of fools.</p>
<p><i>De stultiti&acirc;</i>.&mdash;What petty things they are we
wonder at, like children that esteem every trifle, and prefer a
fairing before their fathers!&nbsp; What difference is between us
and them but that we are dearer fools, coxcombs at a higher
rate?&nbsp; They are pleased with cockleshells, whistles,
hobby-horses, and such like; we with statues, marble pillars,
pictures, gilded roofs, where underneath is lath and lime,
perhaps loam.&nbsp; Yet we take pleasure in the lie, and are glad
we can cozen ourselves.&nbsp; Nor is it only in our walls and
ceilings, but all that we call happiness is mere painting and
gilt, and all for money.&nbsp; What a thin membrane of honour
that is! and how hath all true reputation fallen, since money
began to have any!&nbsp; Yet the great herd, the multitude, that
in all other things are divided, in this alone conspire and
agree&mdash;to love money.&nbsp; They wish for it, they embrace
it, they adore it, while yet it is possessed with greater stir
and torment than it is gotten.</p>
<p><i>De sibi molestis</i>.&mdash;Some men what losses soever
they have they make them greater, and if they have none, even all
that is not gotten is a loss.&nbsp; Can there be creatures of
more wretched condition than these, that continually labour under
their own misery and others&rsquo; envy?&nbsp; A man should study
other things, not to covet, not to fear, not to repent him; to
make his base such as no tempest shall shake him; to be secure of
all opinion, and pleasing to himself, even for that wherein he
displeaseth others; for the worst opinion gotten for doing well,
should delight us.&nbsp; Wouldst not thou be just but for fame,
thou oughtest to be it with infamy; he that would have his virtue
published is not the servant of virtue, but glory.</p>
<p><i>Periculosa melancholia</i>.&mdash;It is a dangerous thing
when men&rsquo;s minds come to sojourn with their affections, and
their diseases eat into their strength; that when too much desire
and greediness of vice hath made the body unfit, or unprofitable,
it is yet gladded with the sight and spectacle of it in others;
and for want of ability to be an actor, is content to be a
witness.&nbsp; It enjoys the pleasure of sinning in beholding
others sin, as in dining, drinking, drabbing, &amp;c.&nbsp; Nay,
when it cannot do all these, it is offended with his own
narrowness, that excludes it from the universal delights of
mankind, and oftentimes dies of a melancholy, that it cannot be
vicious enough.</p>
<p><i>Fals&aelig; species fugiend&aelig;</i>.&mdash;I am glad
when I see any man avoid the infamy of a vice; but to shun the
vice itself were better.&nbsp; Till he do that he is but like the
&rsquo;pientice, who, being loth to be spied by his master coming
forth of Black Lucy&rsquo;s, went in again; to whom his master
cried, &ldquo;The more thou runnest that way to hide thyself, the
more thou art in the place.&rdquo;&nbsp; So are those that keep a
tavern all day, that they may not be seen at night.&nbsp; I have
known lawyers, divines&mdash;yea, great ones&mdash;of this
heresy.</p>
<p><i>Decipimur specie</i>.&mdash;There is a greater reverence
had of things remote or strange to us than of much better if they
be nearer and fall under our sense.&nbsp; Men, and almost all
sorts of creatures, have their reputation by distance.&nbsp;
Rivers, the farther they run, and more from their spring, the
broader they are, and greater.&nbsp; And where our original is
known, we are less the confident; among strangers we trust
fortune.&nbsp; Yet a man may live as renowned at home, in his own
country, or a private village, as in the whole world.&nbsp; For
it is virtue that gives glory; that will endenizen a man
everywhere.&nbsp; It is only that can naturalise him.&nbsp; A
native, if he be vicious, deserves to be a stranger, and cast out
of the commonwealth as an alien.</p>
<p><i>Dejectio Aulic</i>.&mdash;A dejected countenance and mean
clothes beget often a contempt, but it is with the shallowest
creatures; courtiers commonly: look up even with them in a new
suit, you get above them straight.&nbsp; Nothing is more
short-lived than pride; it is but while their clothes last: stay
but while these are worn out, you cannot wish the thing more
wretched or dejected.</p>
<p><i>Poesis</i>, <i>et pictura</i>.&mdash;<i>Plutarch</i>.&nbsp;
Poetry and picture are arts of a like nature, and both are busy
about imitation.&nbsp; It was excellently said of Plutarch,
poetry was a speaking picture, and picture a mute poesy.&nbsp;
For they both invent, feign and devise many things, and
accommodate all they invent to the use and service of
Nature.&nbsp; Yet of the two, the pen is more noble than the
pencil; for that can speak to the understanding, the other but to
the sense.&nbsp; They both behold pleasure and profit as their
common object; but should abstain from all base pleasures, lest
they should err from their end, and, while they seek to better
men&rsquo;s minds, destroy their manners.&nbsp; They both are
born artificers, not made.&nbsp; Nature is more powerful in them
than study.</p>
<p><i>De pictura</i>.&mdash;Whosoever loves not picture is
injurious to truth and all the wisdom of poetry.&nbsp; Picture is
the invention of heaven, the most ancient and most akin to
Nature.&nbsp; It is itself a silent work, and always of one and
the same habit; yet it doth so enter and penetrate the inmost
affection (being done by an excellent artificer) as sometimes it
overcomes the power of speech and oratory.&nbsp; There are divers
graces in it, so are there in the artificers.&nbsp; One excels in
care, another in reason, a third in easiness, a fourth in nature
and grace.&nbsp; Some have diligence and comeliness, but they
want majesty.&nbsp; They can express a human form in all the
graces, sweetness, and elegancy, but, they miss the
authority.&nbsp; They can hit nothing but smooth cheeks; they
cannot express roughness or gravity.&nbsp; Others aspire to truth
so much as they are rather lovers of likeness than beauty.&nbsp;
Zeuxis and Parrhasius are said to be contemporaries; the first
found out the reason of lights and shadows in picture, the other
more subtlely examined the line.</p>
<p><i>De stylo</i>.&mdash;<i>Pliny</i>.&mdash;In picture light is
required no less than shadow; so in style, height as well as
humbleness.&nbsp; But beware they be not too humble, as Pliny
pronounced of Regulus&rsquo;s writings.&nbsp; You would think
them written, not on a child, but by a child.&nbsp; Many, out of
their own obscene apprehensions, refuse proper and fit
words&mdash;as occupy, Nature, and the like; so the curious
industry in some, of having all alike good, hath come nearer a
vice than a virtue.</p>
<p><i>De progres. pictur&aelig;</i>. <a name="citation93"></a><a
href="#footnote93" class="citation">[93]</a>&nbsp; Picture took
her feigning from poetry; from geometry her rule, compass, lines,
proportion, and the whole symmetry.&nbsp; Parrhasius was the
first won reputation by adding symmetry to picture; he added
subtlety to the countenance, elegancy to the hair, love-lines to
the face, and by the public voice of all artificers, deserved
honour in the outer lines.&nbsp; Eupompus gave it splendour by
numbers and other elegancies.&nbsp; From the optics it drew
reasons, by which it considered how things placed at distance and
afar off should appear less; how above or beneath the head should
deceive the eye, &amp;c.&nbsp; So from thence it took shadows,
recessor, light, and heightnings.&nbsp; From moral philosophy it
took the soul, the expression of senses, perturbations, manners,
when they would paint an angry person, a proud, an inconstant, an
ambitious, a brave, a magnanimous, a just, a merciful, a
compassionate, an humble, a dejected, a base, and the like; they
made all heightnings bright, all shadows dark, all swellings from
a plane, all solids from breaking.&nbsp; See where he complains
of their painting Chim&aelig;ras <a name="citation94"></a><a
href="#footnote94" class="citation">[94]</a> (by the vulgar
unaptly called grotesque) saying that men who were born truly to
study and emulate Nature did nothing but make monsters against
Nature, which Horace so laughed at. <a name="citation95"></a><a
href="#footnote95" class="citation">[95]</a> The art plastic was
moulding in clay, or potter&rsquo;s earth anciently.&nbsp; This
is the parent of statuary, sculpture, graving, and picture;
cutting in brass and marble, all serve under her.&nbsp; Socrates
taught Parrhasius and Clito (two noble statuaries) first to
express manners by their looks in imagery.&nbsp; Polygnotus and
Aglaophon were ancienter.&nbsp; After them Zeuxis, who was the
lawgiver to all painters; after, Parrhasius.&nbsp; They were
contemporaries, and lived both about Philip&rsquo;s time, the
father of Alexander the Great.&nbsp; There lived in this latter
age six famous painters in Italy, who were excellent and emulous
of the ancients&mdash;Raphael de Urbino, Michael Angelo
Buonarotti, Titian, Antony of Correggio, Sebastian of Venice,
Julio Romano, and Andrea Sartorio.</p>
<p><i>Parasiti ad mensam</i>.&mdash;These are flatterers for
their bread, that praise all my oraculous lord does or says, be
it true or false; invent tales that shall please; make baits for
his lordship&rsquo;s ears; and if they be not received in what
they offer at, they shift a point of the compass, and turn their
tale, presently tack about, deny what they confessed, and confess
what they denied; fit their discourse to the persons and
occasions.&nbsp; What they snatch up and devour at one table,
utter at another; and grow suspected of the master, hated of the
servants, while they inquire, and reprehend, and compound, and
dilate business of the house they have nothing to do with.&nbsp;
They praise my lord&rsquo;s wine and the sauce he likes; observe
the cook and bottle-man; while they stand in my lord&rsquo;s
favour, speak for a pension for them, but pound them to dust upon
my lord&rsquo;s least distaste, or change of his palate.</p>
<p>How much better is it to be silent, or at least to speak
sparingly! for it is not enough to speak good, but timely
things.&nbsp; If a man be asked a question, to answer; but to
repeat the question before he answer is well, that he be sure to
understand it, to avoid absurdity; for it is less dishonour to
hear imperfectly than to speak imperfectly.&nbsp; The ears are
excused, the understanding is not.&nbsp; And in things unknown to
a man, not to give his opinion, lest by the affectation of
knowing too much he lose the credit he hath, by speaking or
knowing the wrong way what he utters.&nbsp; Nor seek to get his
patron&rsquo;s favour by embarking himself in the factions of the
family, to inquire after domestic simulties, their sports or
affections.&nbsp; They are an odious and vile kind of creatures,
that fly about the house all day, and picking up the filth of the
house like pies or swallows, carry it to their nest (the
lord&rsquo;s ears), and oftentimes report the lies they have
feigned for what they have seen and heard.</p>
<p><i>Im&ograve; serviles</i>.&mdash;These are called instruments
of grace and power with great persons, but they are indeed the
organs of their impotency, and marks of weakness.&nbsp; For
sufficient lords are able to make these discoveries
themselves.&nbsp; Neither will an honourable person inquire who
eats and drinks together, what that man plays, whom this man
loves, with whom such a one walks, what discourse they hold, who
sleeps with whom.&nbsp; They are base and servile natures that
busy themselves about these disquisitions.&nbsp; How often have I
seen (and worthily) these censors of the family undertaken by
some honest rustic and cudgelled thriftily!&nbsp; These are
commonly the off-scouring and dregs of men that do these things,
or calumniate others; yet I know not truly which is
worse&mdash;he that maligns all, or that praises all.&nbsp; There
is as a vice in praising, and as frequent, as in detracting.</p>
<p>It pleased your lordship of late to ask my opinion touching
the education of your sons, and especially to the advancement of
their studies.&nbsp; To which, though I returned somewhat for the
present, which rather manifested a will in me than gave any just
resolution to the thing propounded, I have upon better cogitation
called those aids about me, both of mind and memory, which shall
venture my thoughts clearer, if not fuller, to your
lordship&rsquo;s demand.&nbsp; I confess, my lord, they will seem
but petty and minute things I shall offer to you, being writ for
children, and of them.&nbsp; But studies have their infancy as
well as creatures.&nbsp; We see in men even the strongest
compositions had their beginnings from milk and the cradle; and
the wisest tarried sometimes about apting their mouths to letters
and syllables.&nbsp; In their education, therefore, the care must
be the greater had of their beginnings, to know, examine, and
weigh their natures; which, though they be proner in some
children to some disciplines, yet are they naturally prompt to
taste all by degrees, and with change.&nbsp; For change is a kind
of refreshing in studies, and infuseth knowledge by way of
recreation.&nbsp; Thence the school itself is called a play or
game, and all letters are so best taught to scholars.&nbsp; They
should not be affrighted or deterred in their entry, but drawn on
with exercise and emulation.&nbsp; A youth should not be made to
hate study before he know the causes to love it, or taste the
bitterness before the sweet; but called on and allured, entreated
and praised&mdash;yea, when he deserves it not.&nbsp; For which
cause I wish them sent to the best school, and a public, which I
think the best.&nbsp; Your lordship, I fear, hardly hears of
that, as willing to breed them in your eye and at home, and
doubting their manners may be corrupted abroad.&nbsp; They are in
more danger in your own family, among ill servants (allowing they
be safe in their schoolmaster), than amongst a thousand boys,
however immodest.&nbsp; Would we did not spoil our own children,
and overthrow their manners ourselves by too much
indulgence!&nbsp; To breed them at home is to breed them in a
shade, whereas in a school they have the light and heat of the
sun.&nbsp; They are used and accustomed to things and men.&nbsp;
When they come forth into the common-wealth, they find nothing
new, or to seek.&nbsp; They have made their friendships and aids,
some to last their age.&nbsp; They hear what is commanded to
others as well as themselves; much approved, much corrected; all
which they bring to their own store and use, and learn as much as
they hear.&nbsp; Eloquence would be but a poor thing if we should
only converse with singulars, speak but man and man
together.&nbsp; Therefore I like no private breeding.&nbsp; I
would send them where their industry should be daily increased by
praise, and that kindled by emulation.&nbsp; It is a good thing
to inflame the mind; and though ambition itself be a vice, it is
often the cause of great virtue.&nbsp; Give me that wit whom
praise excites, glory puts on, or disgrace grieves; he is to be
nourished with ambition, pricked forward with honour, checked
with reprehension, and never to be suspected of sloth.&nbsp;
Though he be given to play, it is a sign of spirit and
liveliness, so there be a mean had of their sports and
relaxations.&nbsp; And from the rod or ferule I would have them
free, as from the menace of them; for it is both deformed and
servile.</p>
<p><i>De stylo</i>, <i>et optimo scribendi genere</i>.&mdash;For
a man to write well, there are required three
necessaries&mdash;to read the best authors, observe the best
speakers, and much exercise of his own style; in style to
consider what ought to be written, and after what manner.&nbsp;
He must first think and excogitate his matter, then choose his
words, and examine the weight of either.&nbsp; Then take care, in
placing and ranking both matter and words, that the composition
be comely; and to do this with diligence and often.&nbsp; No
matter how slow the style be at first, so it be laboured and
accurate; seek the best, and be not glad of the froward conceits,
or first words, that offer themselves to us; but judge of what we
invent, and order what we approve.&nbsp; Repeat often what we
have formerly written; which beside that it helps the
consequence, and makes the juncture better, it quickens the heat
of imagination, that often cools in the time of setting down, and
gives it new strength, as if it grew lustier by the going back;
as we see in the contention of leaping, they jump farthest that
fetch their race largest; or, as in throwing a dart or javelin,
we force back our arms to make our loose the stronger.&nbsp; Yet,
if we have a fair gale of wind, I forbid not the steering out of
our sail, so the favour of the gale deceive us not.&nbsp; For all
that we invent doth please us in conception of birth, else we
would never set it down.&nbsp; But the safest is to return to our
judgment, and handle over again those things the easiness of
which might make them justly suspected.&nbsp; So did the best
writers in their beginnings; they imposed upon themselves care
and industry; they did nothing rashly: they obtained first to
write well, and then custom made it easy and a habit.&nbsp; By
little and little their matter showed itself to them more
plentifully; their words answered, their composition followed;
and all, as in a well-ordered family, presented itself in the
place.&nbsp; So that the sum of all is, ready writing makes not
good writing, but good writing brings on ready writing yet, when
we think we have got the faculty, it is even then good to resist
it, as to give a horse a check sometimes with a bit, which doth
not so much stop his course as stir his mettle.&nbsp; Again,
whether a man&rsquo;s genius is best able to reach thither, it
should more and more contend, lift and dilate itself, as men of
low stature raise themselves on their toes, and so ofttimes get
even, if not eminent.&nbsp; Besides, as it is fit for grown and
able writers to stand of themselves, and work with their own
strength, to trust and endeavour by their own faculties, so it is
fit for the beginner and learner to study others and the
best.&nbsp; For the mind and memory are more sharply exercised in
comprehending another man&rsquo;s things than our own; and such
as accustom themselves and are familiar with the best authors
shall ever and anon find somewhat of them in themselves, and in
the expression of their minds, even when they feel it not, be
able to utter something like theirs, which hath an authority
above their own.&nbsp; Nay, sometimes it is the reward of a
man&rsquo;s study, the praise of quoting another man fitly; and
though a man be more prone and able for one kind of writing than
another, yet he must exercise all.&nbsp; For as in an instrument,
so in style, there must be a harmony and consent of parts.</p>
<p><i>Pr&aelig;cipiendi modi</i>.&mdash;I take this labour in
teaching others, that they should not be always to be taught, and
I would bring my precepts into practice, for rules are ever of
less force and value than experiments; yet with this purpose,
rather to show the right way to those that come after, than to
detect any that have slipped before by error, and I hope it will
be more profitable.&nbsp; For men do more willingly listen, and
with more favour, to precept, than reprehension.&nbsp; Among
divers opinions of an art, and most of them contrary in
themselves, it is hard to make election; and, therefore, though a
man cannot invent new things after so many, he may do a welcome
work yet to help posterity to judge rightly of the old.&nbsp; But
arts and precepts avail nothing, except Nature be beneficial and
aiding.&nbsp; And therefore these things are no more written to a
dull disposition, than rules of husbandry to a soil.&nbsp; No
precepts will profit a fool, no more than beauty will the blind,
or music the deaf.&nbsp; As we should take care that our style in
writing be neither dry nor empty, we should look again it be not
winding, or wanton with far-fetched descriptions; either is a
vice.&nbsp; But that is worse which proceeds out of want, than
that which riots out of plenty.&nbsp; The remedy of fruitfulness
is easy, but no labour will help the contrary; I will like and
praise some things in a young writer which yet, if he continue
in, I cannot but justly hate him for the same.&nbsp; There is a
time to be given all things for maturity, and that even your
country husband-man can teach, who to a young plant will not put
the pruning-knife, because it seems to fear the iron, as not able
to admit the scar.&nbsp; No more would I tell a green writer all
his faults, lest I should make him grieve and faint, and at last
despair; for nothing doth more hurt than to make him so afraid of
all things as he can endeavour nothing.&nbsp; Therefore youth
ought to be instructed betimes, and in the best things; for we
hold those longest we take soonest, as the first scent of a
vessel lasts, and the tint the wool first receives; therefore a
master should temper his own powers, and descend to the
other&rsquo;s infirmity.&nbsp; If you pour a glut of water upon a
bottle, it receives little of it; but with a funnel, and by
degrees, you shall fill many of them, and spill little of your
own; to their capacity they will all receive and be full.&nbsp;
And as it is fit to read the best authors to youth first, so let
them be of the openest and clearest. <a
name="citation106a"></a><a href="#footnote106a"
class="citation">[106a]</a>&nbsp; As Livy before Sallust, Sidney
before Donne; and beware of letting them taste Gower or Chaucer
at first, lest, falling too much in love with antiquity, and not
apprehending the weight, they grow rough and barren in language
only.&nbsp; When their judgments are firm, and out of danger, let
them read both the old and the new; but no less take heed that
their new flowers and sweetness do not as much corrupt as the
others&rsquo; dryness and squalor, if they choose not
carefully.&nbsp; Spenser, in affecting the ancients, writ no
language; yet I would have him read for his matter, but as Virgil
read Ennius.&nbsp; The reading of Homer and Virgil is counselled
by Quintilian as the best way of informing youth and confirming
man.&nbsp; For, besides that the mind is raised with the height
and sublimity of such a verse, it takes spirit from the greatness
of the matter, and is tinctured with the best things.&nbsp;
Tragic and lyric poetry is good, too, and comic with the best, if
the manners of the reader be once in safety.&nbsp; In the Greek
poets, as also in Plautus, we shall see the economy and
disposition of poems better observed than in Terence; and the
latter, who thought the sole grace and virtue of their fable the
sticking in of sentences, as ours do the forcing in of jests.</p>
<p><i>Fals. querel. fugiend. Platonis peregrinatio in
Italiam</i>.&mdash;We should not protect our sloth with the
patronage of difficulty.&nbsp; It is a false quarrel against
Nature, that she helps understanding but in a few, when the most
part of mankind are inclined by her thither, if they would take
the pains; no less than birds to fly, horses to run, &amp;c.,
which if they lose, it is through their own sluggishness, and by
that means become her prodigies, not her children.&nbsp; I
confess, Nature in children is more patient of labour in study
than in age; for the sense of the pain, the judgment of the
labour is absent; they do not measure what they have done.&nbsp;
And it is the thought and consideration that affects us more than
the weariness itself.&nbsp; Plato was not content with the
learning that Athens could give him, but sailed into Italy, for
Pythagoras&rsquo; knowledge: and yet not thinking himself
sufficiently informed, went into Egypt, to the priests, and
learned their mysteries.&nbsp; He laboured, so must we.&nbsp;
Many things may be learned together, and performed in one point
of time; as musicians exercise their memory, their voice, their
fingers, and sometimes their head and feet at once.&nbsp; And so
a preacher, in the invention of matter, election of words,
composition of gesture, look, pronunciation, motion, useth all
these faculties at once: and if we can express this variety
together, why should not divers studies, at divers hours,
delight, when the variety is able alone to refresh and repair
us?&nbsp; As, when a man is weary of writing, to read; and then
again of reading, to write.&nbsp; Wherein, howsoever we do many
things, yet are we (in a sort) still fresh to what we begin; we
are recreated with change, as the stomach is with meats.&nbsp;
But some will say this variety breeds confusion, and makes, that
either we lose all, or hold no more than the last.&nbsp; Why do
we not then persuade husbandmen that they should not till land,
help it with marl, lime, and compost? plant hop-gardens, prune
trees, look to bee-hives, rear sheep, and all other cattle at
once?&nbsp; It is easier to do many things and continue, than to
do one thing long.</p>
<p><i>Pr&aelig;cept. element</i>.&mdash;It is not the passing
through these learnings that hurts us, but the dwelling and
sticking about them.&nbsp; To descend to those extreme anxieties
and foolish cavils of grammarians, is able to break a wit in
pieces, being a work of manifold misery and vainness, to be
<i>elementarii senes</i>.&nbsp; Yet even letters are, as it were,
the bank of words, and restore themselves to an author as the
pawns of language: but talking and eloquence are not the same: to
speak, and to speak well, are two things.&nbsp; A fool may talk,
but a wise man speaks; and out of the observation, knowledge, and
the use of things, many writers perplex their readers and hearers
with mere nonsense.&nbsp; Their writings need sunshine.&nbsp;
Pure and neat language I love, yet plain and customary.&nbsp; A
barbarous phrase has often made me out of love with a good sense,
and doubtful writing hath wracked me beyond my patience.&nbsp;
The reason why a poet is said that he ought to have all
knowledges is, that he should not be ignorant of the most,
especially of those he will handle.&nbsp; And indeed, when the
attaining of them is possible, it were a sluggish and base thing
to despair; for frequent imitation of anything becomes a habit
quickly.&nbsp; If a man should prosecute as much as could be said
of everything, his work would find no end.</p>
<p><i>De orationis dignitate</i>.&nbsp;
&rsquo;&Epsilon;&gamma;&kappa;&upsilon;&kappa;&lambda;&omicron;&pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha;.&mdash;<i>Metaphora</i>.&nbsp;
Speech is the only benefit man hath to express his excellency of
mind above other creatures.&nbsp; It is the instrument of
society; therefore Mercury, who is the president of language, is
called <i>deorum hominumque interpres</i>. <a
name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a"
class="citation">[110a]</a>&nbsp; In all speech, words and sense
are as the body and the soul.&nbsp; The sense is as the life and
soul of language, without which all words are dead.&nbsp; Sense
is wrought out of experience, the knowledge of human life and
actions, or of the liberal arts, which the Greeks called
&rsquo;&Epsilon;&gamma;&kappa;&upsilon;&kappa;&lambda;&omicron;&pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha;&nu;.&nbsp;
Words are the people&rsquo;s, yet there is a choice of them to be
made; for <i>verborum delectus origo est eloquenti&aelig;</i>. <a
name="citation111a"></a><a href="#footnote111a"
class="citation">[111a]</a>&nbsp; They are to be chosen according
to the persons we make speak, or the things we speak of.&nbsp;
Some are of the camp, some of the council-board, some of the
shop, some of the sheepcote, some of the pulpit, some of the Bar,
&amp;c.&nbsp; And herein is seen their elegance and propriety,
when we use them fitly and draw them forth to their just strength
and nature by way of translation or metaphor.&nbsp; But in this
translation we must only serve necessity (<i>nam temer&egrave;
nihil transfertur &agrave; prudenti</i>) <a
name="citation111b"></a><a href="#footnote111b"
class="citation">[111b]</a> or commodity, which is a kind of
necessity: that is, when we either absolutely want a word to
express by, and that is necessity; or when we have not so fit a
word, and that is commodity; as when we avoid loss by it, and
escape obsceneness, and gain in the grace and property which
helps significance.&nbsp; Metaphors far-fetched hinder to be
understood; and affected, lose their grace.&nbsp; Or when the
person fetcheth his translations from a wrong place as if a privy
councillor should at the table take his metaphor from a
dicing-house, or ordinary, or a vintner&rsquo;s vault; or a
justice of peace draw his similitudes from the mathematics, or a
divine from a bawdy house, or taverns; or a gentleman of
Northamptonshire, Warwickshire, or the Midland, should fetch all
the illustrations to his country neighbours from shipping, and
tell them of the main-sheet and the bowline.&nbsp; Metaphors are
thus many times deformed, as in him that said, <i>Castratam morte
Africani rempublicam</i>; and another, <i>Stercus curi&aelig;
Glauciam</i>, and <i>Can&acirc; nive conspuit Alpes</i>.&nbsp;
All attempts that are new in this kind, are dangerous, and
somewhat hard, before they be softened with use.&nbsp; A man
coins not a new word without some peril and less fruit; for if it
happen to be received, the praise is but moderate; if refused,
the scorn is assured.&nbsp; Yet we must adventure; for things at
first hard and rough are by use made tender and gentle.&nbsp; It
is an honest error that is committed, following great chiefs.</p>
<p><i>Consuetudo</i>.&mdash;<i>Perspicuitas</i>,
<i>Venustas</i>.&mdash;<i>Authoritas</i>.&mdash;<i>Virgil</i>.&mdash;<i>Lucretius</i>.&mdash;<i>Chaucerism</i>.&mdash;<i>Paronomasia</i>.&mdash;Custom
is the most certain mistress of language, as the public stamp
makes the current money.&nbsp; But we must not be too frequent
with the mint, every day coining, nor fetch words from the
extreme and utmost ages; since the chief virtue of a style is
perspicuity, and nothing so vicious in it as to need an
interpreter.&nbsp; Words borrowed of antiquity do lend a kind of
majesty to style, and are not without their delight sometimes;
for they have the authority of years, and out of their
intermission do win themselves a kind of grace like
newness.&nbsp; But the eldest of the present, and newness of the
past language, is the best.&nbsp; For what was the ancient
language, which some men so dote upon, but the ancient
custom?&nbsp; Yet when I name custom, I understand not the vulgar
custom; for that were a precept no less dangerous to language
than life, if we should speak or live after the manners of the
vulgar: but that I call custom of speech, which is the consent of
the learned; as custom of life, which is the consent of the
good.&nbsp; Virgil was most loving of antiquity; yet how rarely
doth he insert <i>aquai</i> and <i>pictai</i>!&nbsp; Lucretius is
scabrous and rough in these; he seeks them: as some do
Chaucerisms with us, which were better expunged and
banished.&nbsp; Some words are to be culled out for ornament and
colour, as we gather flowers to strew houses or make garlands;
but they are better when they grow to our style; as in a meadow,
where, though the mere grass and greenness delight, yet the
variety of flowers doth heighten and beautify.&nbsp; Marry, we
must not play or riot too much with them, as in Paronomasies; nor
use too swelling or ill-sounding words!&nbsp; <i>Qu&aelig; per
salebras</i>, <i>altaque saxa cadunt</i>. <a
name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a>&nbsp; It is true, there is no sound
but shall find some lovers, as the bitterest confections are
grateful to some palates.&nbsp; Our composition must be more
accurate in the beginning and end than in the midst, and in the
end more than in the beginning; for through the midst the stream
bears us.&nbsp; And this is attained by custom, more than care of
diligence.&nbsp; We must express readily and fully, not
profusely.&nbsp; There is difference between a liberal and
prodigal hand.&nbsp; As it is a great point of art, when our
matter requires it, to enlarge and veer out all sail, so to take
it in and contract it, is of no less praise, when the argument
doth ask it.&nbsp; Either of them hath their fitness in the
place.&nbsp; A good man always profits by his endeavour, by his
help, yea, when he is absent; nay, when he is dead, by his
example and memory.&nbsp; So good authors in their style: a
strict and succinct style is that where you can take away nothing
without loss, and that loss to be manifest.</p>
<p><i>De Stylo</i>.&mdash;<i>Tracitus</i>.&mdash;<i>The
Laconic</i>.&mdash;<i>Suetonius</i>.&mdash;<i>Seneca and
Fabianus</i>.&mdash;The brief style is that which expresseth much
in little; the concise style, which expresseth not enough, but
leaves somewhat to be understood; the abrupt style, which hath
many breaches, and doth not seem to end, but fall.&nbsp; The
congruent and harmonious fitting of parts in a sentence hath
almost the fastening and force of knitting and connection; as in
stones well squared, which will rise strong a great way without
mortar.</p>
<p><i>Periodi</i>.&mdash;<i>Obscuritas offundit
tenebras</i>.&mdash;<i>Superlatio</i>.&mdash;Periods are
beautiful when they are not too long; for so they have their
strength too, as in a pike or javelin.&nbsp; As we must take the
care that our words and sense be clear, so if the obscurity
happen through the hearer&rsquo;s or reader&rsquo;s want of
understanding, I am not to answer for them, no more than for
their not listening or marking; I must neither find them ears nor
mind.&nbsp; But a man cannot put a word so in sense but something
about it will illustrate it, if the writer understand himself;
for order helps much to perspicuity, as confusion hurts.&nbsp;
(<i>Rectitudo lucem adfert</i>; <i>obliquitas et circumductio
offuscat</i>. <a name="citation116a"></a><a href="#footnote116a"
class="citation">[116a]</a>)&nbsp; We should therefore speak what
we can the nearest way, so as we keep our gait, not leap; for too
short may as well be not let into the memory, as too long not
kept in.&nbsp; Whatsoever loseth the grace and clearness,
converts into a riddle; the obscurity is marked, but not the
value.&nbsp; That perisheth, and is passed by, like the pearl in
the fable.&nbsp; Our style should be like a skein of silk, to be
carried and found by the right thread, not ravelled and
perplexed; then all is a knot, a heap.&nbsp; There are words that
do as much raise a style as others can depress it.&nbsp;
Superlation and over-muchness amplifies; it may be above faith,
but never above a mean.&nbsp; It was ridiculous in Cestius, when
he said of Alexander:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Fremit oceanus, quasi indignetur,
qu&ograve;d terras relinquas.&rdquo; <a
name="citation117a"></a><a href="#footnote117a"
class="citation">[117a]</a></p>
<p>But propitiously from Virgil:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Credas innare revulsas<br />
Cycladas.&rdquo; <a name="citation117b"></a><a
href="#footnote117b" class="citation">[117b]</a></p>
<p>He doth not say it was so, but seemed to be so.&nbsp; Although
it be somewhat incredible, that is excused before it be
spoken.&nbsp; But there are hyperboles which will become one
language, that will by no means admit another.&nbsp; As <i>Eos
esse</i> P. R. <i>exercitus</i>, <i>qui c&aelig;lum possint
perrumpere</i>, <a name="citation118a"></a><a
href="#footnote118a" class="citation">[118a]</a> who would say
with us, but a madman?&nbsp; Therefore we must consider in every
tongue what is used, what received.&nbsp; Quintilian warns us,
that in no kind of translation, or metaphor, or allegory, we make
a turn from what we began; as if we fetch the original of our
metaphor from sea and billows, we end not in flames and ashes: it
is a most foul inconsequence.&nbsp; Neither must we draw out our
allegory too long, lest either we make ourselves obscure, or fall
into affectation, which is childish.&nbsp; But why do men depart
at all from the right and natural ways of speaking? sometimes for
necessity, when we are driven, or think it fitter, to speak that
in obscure words, or by circumstance, which uttered plainly would
offend the hearers.&nbsp; Or to avoid obsceneness, or sometimes
for pleasure, and variety, as travellers turn out of the highway,
drawn either by the commodity of a footpath, or the delicacy or
freshness of the fields.&nbsp; And all this is called
&epsilon;&sigma;&chi;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&eta;
or figured language.</p>
<p><i>Oratio imago animi</i>.&mdash;Language most shows a man:
Speak, that I may see thee.&nbsp; It springs out of the most
retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of
it, the mind.&nbsp; No glass renders a man&rsquo;s form or
likeness so true as his speech.&nbsp; Nay, it is likened to a
man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so
words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure,
and harmony of it.</p>
<p><i>Structura et statura</i>, <i>sublimis</i>, <i>humilis</i>,
<i>pumila</i>.&mdash;Some men are tall and big, so some language
is high and great.&nbsp; Then the words are chosen, their sound
ample, the composition full, the absolution plenteous, and poured
out, all grave, sinewy, and strong.&nbsp; Some are little and
dwarfs; so of speech, it is humble and low, the words poor and
flat, the members and periods thin and weak, without knitting or
number.</p>
<p><i>Mediocris plana et placida</i>.&mdash;The middle are of a
just stature.&nbsp; There the language is plain and pleasing;
even without stopping, round without swelling: all well-turned,
composed, elegant, and accurate.</p>
<p><i>Vitiosa oratio</i>,
<i>vasta</i>&mdash;<i>tumens</i>&mdash;<i>enormis</i>&mdash;<i>affectata</i>&mdash;<i>abjecta</i>.&mdash;The
vicious language is vast and gaping, swelling and irregular: when
it contends to be high, full of rock, mountain, and pointedness;
as it affects to be low, it is abject, and creeps, full of bogs
and holes.&nbsp; And according to their subject these styles
vary, and lose their names: for that which is high and lofty,
declaring excellent matter, becomes vast and tumorous, speaking
of petty and inferior things; so that which was even and apt in a
mean and plain subject, will appear most poor and humble in a
high argument.&nbsp; Would you not laugh to meet a great
councillor of State in a flat cap, with his trunk hose, and a
hobbyhorse cloak, his gloves under his girdle, and yond
haberdasher in a velvet gown, furred with sables?&nbsp; There is
a certain latitude in these things, by which we find the
degrees.</p>
<p><i>Figura</i>.&mdash;The next thing to the stature, is the
figure and feature in language&mdash;that is, whether it be round
and straight, which consists of short and succinct periods,
numerous and polished; or square and firm, which is to have equal
and strong parts everywhere answerable, and weighed.</p>
<p><i>Cutis sive cortex</i>.&nbsp; <i>Compositio</i>.&mdash;The
third is the skin and coat, which rests in the well-joining,
cementing, and coagmentation of words; whenas it is smooth,
gentle, and sweet, like a table upon which you may run your
finger without rubs, and your nail cannot find a joint; not
horrid, rough, wrinkled, gaping, or chapped: after these, the
flesh, blood, and bones come in question.</p>

<p><i>Carnosa</i>&mdash;<i>adipata</i>&mdash;<i>redundans</i>.&mdash;We
say it is a fleshy style, when there is much periphrasis, and
circuit of words; and when with more than enough, it grows fat
and corpulent: <i>arvina orationis</i>, full of suet and
tallow.&nbsp; It hath blood and juice when the words are proper
and apt, their sound sweet, and the phrase neat and
picked&mdash;<i>oratio uncta</i>, <i>et ben&egrave;
pasta</i>.&nbsp; But where there is redundancy, both the blood
and juice are faulty and vicious:&mdash;<i>Redundat sanguine</i>,
<i>quia multo plus dicit</i>, <i>quam necesse est</i>.&nbsp;
Juice in language is somewhat less than blood; for if the words
be but becoming and signifying, and the sense gentle, there is
juice; but where that wanteth, the language is thin, flagging,
poor, starved, scarce covering the bone, and shows like stones in
a sack.</p>
<p><i>Jejuna</i>, <i>macilenta</i>,
<i>strigosa</i>.&mdash;<i>Ossea</i>, <i>et
nervosa</i>.&mdash;Some men, to avoid redundancy, run into that;
and while they strive to have no ill blood or juice, they lose
their good.&nbsp; There be some styles, again, that have not less
blood, but less flesh and corpulence.&nbsp; These are bony and
sinewy; <i>Ossa habent</i>, <i>et nervos</i>.</p>
<p><i>Not&aelig; domini Sti. Albani de doctrin.
intemper</i>.&mdash;<i>Dictator</i>.&mdash;<i>Aristoteles</i>.&mdash;It
was well noted by the late Lord St. Albans, that the study of
words is the first distemper of learning; vain matter the second;
and a third distemper is deceit, or the likeness of truth:
imposture held up by credulity.&nbsp; All these are the cobwebs
of learning, and to let them grow in us is either sluttish or
foolish.&nbsp; Nothing is more ridiculous than to make an author
a dictator, as the schools have done Aristotle.&nbsp; The damage
is infinite knowledge receives by it; for to many things a man
should owe but a temporary belief, and suspension of his own
judgment, not an absolute resignation of himself, or a perpetual
captivity.&nbsp; Let Aristotle and others have their dues; but if
we can make farther discoveries of truth and fitness than they,
why are we envied?&nbsp; Let us beware, while we strive to add,
we do not diminish or deface; we may improve, but not
augment.&nbsp; By discrediting falsehood, truth grows in
request.&nbsp; We must not go about, like men anguished and
perplexed, for vicious affectation of praise, but calmly study
the separation of opinions, find the errors have intervened,
awake antiquity, call former times into question; but make no
parties with the present, nor follow any fierce undertakers,
mingle no matter of doubtful credit with the simplicity of truth,
but gently stir the mould about the root of the question, and
avoid all digladiations, facility of credit, or superstitious
simplicity, seek the consonancy and concatenation of truth; stoop
only to point of necessity, and what leads to convenience.&nbsp;
Then make exact animadversion where style hath degenerated, where
flourished and thrived in choiceness of phrase, round and clean
composition of sentence, sweet falling of the clause, varying an
illustration by tropes and figures, weight of matter, worth of
subject, soundness of argument, life of invention, and depth of
judgment.&nbsp; This is <i>monte potiri</i>, to get the hill; for
no perfect discovery can be made upon a flat or a level.</p>
<p><i>De optimo scriptore</i>.&mdash;<i>Cicero</i>.&mdash;Now
that I have informed you in the knowing of these things, let me
lead you by the hand a little farther, in the direction of the
use, and make you an able writer by practice.&nbsp; The conceits
of the mind are pictures of things, and the tongue is the
interpreter of those pictures.&nbsp; The order of God&rsquo;s
creatures in themselves is not only admirable and glorious, but
eloquent: then he who could apprehend the consequence of things
in their truth, and utter his apprehensions as truly, were the
best writer or speaker.&nbsp; Therefore Cicero said much, when he
said, <i>Dicere recte nemo potest</i>, <i>nisi qui prudenter
intelligit</i>. <a name="citation124a"></a><a
href="#footnote124a" class="citation">[124a]</a>&nbsp; The shame
of speaking unskilfully were small if the tongue only thereby
were disgraced; but as the image of a king in his seal
ill-represented is not so much a blemish to the wax, or the
signet that sealed it, as to the prince it representeth, so
disordered speech is not so much injury to the lips that give it
forth, as to the disproportion and incoherence of things in
themselves, so negligently expressed.&nbsp; Neither can his mind
be thought to be in tune, whose words do jar; nor his reason in
frame, whose sentence is preposterous; nor his elocution clear
and perfect, whose utterance breaks itself into fragments and
uncertainties.&nbsp; Were it not a dishonour to a mighty prince,
to have the majesty of his embassage spoiled by a careless
ambassador? and is it not as great an indignity, that an
excellent conceit and capacity, by the indiligence of an idle
tongue, should be disgraced?&nbsp; Negligent speech doth not only
discredit the person of the speaker, but it discrediteth the
opinion of his reason and judgment; it discrediteth the force and
uniformity of the matter and substance.&nbsp; If it be so then in
words, which fly and escape censure, and where one good phrase
begs pardon for many incongruities and faults, how shall he then
be thought wise whose penning is thin and shallow? how shall you
look for wit from him whose leisure and head, assisted with the
examination of his eyes, yield you no life or sharpness in his
writing?</p>
<p><i>De stylo epistolari</i>.&mdash;<i>Inventio</i>.&mdash;In
writing there is to be regarded the invention and the
fashion.&nbsp; For the invention, that ariseth upon your
business, whereof there can be no rules of more certainty, or
precepts of better direction given, than conjecture can lay down
from the several occasions of men&rsquo;s particular lives and
vocations: but sometimes men make baseness of kindness: As
&ldquo;I could not satisfy myself till I had discharged my
remembrance, and charged my letters with commendation to
you;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;My business is no other than to testify my
love to you, and to put you in mind of my willingness to do you
all kind offices;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Sir, have you leisure to
descend to the remembering of that assurance you have long
possessed in your servant, and upon your next opportunity make
him happy with some commands from you?&rdquo; or the like; that
go a-begging for some meaning, and labour to be delivered of the
great burden of nothing.&nbsp; When you have invented, and that
your business be matter, and not bare form, or mere ceremony, but
some earnest, then are you to proceed to the ordering of it, and
digesting the parts, which is had out of two circumstances.&nbsp;
One is the understanding of the persons to whom you are to write;
the other is the coherence of your sentence; for men&rsquo;s
capacity to weigh what will be apprehended with greatest
attention or leisure; what next regarded and longed for
especially, and what last will leave satisfaction, and (as it
were) the sweetest memorial and belief of all that is passed in
his understanding whom you write to.&nbsp; For the consequence of
sentences, you must be sure that every clause do give the cue one
to the other, and be bespoken ere it come.&nbsp; So much for
invention and order.</p>
<p><i>Modus</i>.&mdash;1.&nbsp; <i>Brevitas</i>.&mdash;Now for
fashion: it consists in four things, which are qualities of your
style.&nbsp; The first is brevity; for they must not be treatises
or discourses (your letters) except it be to learned men.&nbsp;
And even among them there is a kind of thrift and saving of
words.&nbsp; Therefore you are to examine the clearest passages
of your understanding, and through them to convey the sweetest
and most significant words you can devise, that you may the
easier teach them the readiest way to another man&rsquo;s
apprehension, and open their meaning fully, roundly, and
distinctly, so as the reader may not think a second view cast
away upon your letter.&nbsp; And though respect be a part
following this, yet now here, and still I must remember it, if
you write to a man, whose estate and sense, as senses, you are
familiar with, you may the bolder (to set a task to his brain)
venture on a knot.&nbsp; But if to your superior, you are bound
to measure him in three farther points: first, with interest in
him; secondly, his capacity in your letters; thirdly, his leisure
to peruse them.&nbsp; For your interest or favour with him, you
are to be the shorter or longer, more familiar or submiss, as he
will afford you time.&nbsp; For his capacity, you are to be
quicker and fuller of those reaches and glances of wit or
learning, as he is able to entertain them.&nbsp; For his leisure,
you are commanded to the greater briefness, as his place is of
greater discharges and cares.&nbsp; But with your betters, you
are not to put riddles of wit, by being too scarce of words; not
to cause the trouble of making breviates by writing too riotous
and wastingly.&nbsp; Brevity is attained in matter by avoiding
idle compliments, prefaces, protestations, parentheses,
superfluous circuit of figures and digressions: in the
composition, by omitting conjunctions [<i>not only</i>, <i>but
also</i>; <i>both the one and the other</i>, <i>whereby it cometh
to pass</i>] and such like idle particles, that have no great
business in a serious letter but breaking of sentences, as
oftentimes a short journey is made long by unnessary baits.</p>
<p><i>Quintilian</i>.&mdash;But, as Quintilian saith, there is a
briefness of the parts sometimes that makes the whole long:
&ldquo;As I came to the stairs, I took a pair of oars, they
launched out, rowed apace, I landed at the court gate, I paid my
fare, went up to the presence, asked for my lord, I was
admitted.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this is but, &ldquo;I went to the
court and spake with my lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the fault of
some Latin writers within these last hundred years of my reading,
and perhaps Seneca may be appeached of it; I accuse him not.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>Perspicuitas</i>.&mdash;The next property of
epistolary style is perspicuity, and is oftentimes by affectation
of some wit ill angled for, or ostentation of some hidden terms
of art.&nbsp; Few words they darken speech, and so do too many;
as well too much light hurteth the eyes, as too little; and a
long bill of chancery confounds the understanding as much as the
shortest note; therefore, let not your letters be penned like
English statutes, and this is obtained.&nbsp; These vices are
eschewed by pondering your business well and distinctly
concerning yourself, which is much furthered by uttering your
thoughts, and letting them as well come forth to the light and
judgment of your own outward senses as to the censure of other
men&rsquo;s ears; for that is the reason why many good scholars
speak but fumblingly; like a rich man, that for want of
particular note and difference can bring you no certain ware
readily out of his shop.&nbsp; Hence it is that talkative shallow
men do often content the hearers more than the wise.&nbsp; But
this may find a speedier redress in writing, where all comes
under the last examination of the eyes.&nbsp; First, mind it
well, then pen it, then examine it, then amend it, and you may be
in the better hope of doing reasonably well.&nbsp; Under this
virtue may come plainness, which is not to be curious in the
order as to answer a letter, as if you were to answer to
interrogatories.&nbsp; As to the first, first; and to the second,
secondly, &amp;c. but both in method to use (as ladies do in
their attire) a diligent kind of negligence, and their sportive
freedom; though with some men you are not to jest, or practise
tricks; yet the delivery of the most important things may be
carried with such a grace, as that it may yield a pleasure to the
conceit of the reader.&nbsp; There must be store, though no
excess of terms; as if you are to name store, sometimes you may
call it choice, sometimes plenty, sometimes copiousness, or
variety; but ever so, that the word which comes in lieu have not
such difference of meaning as that it may put the sense of the
first in hazard to be mistaken.&nbsp; You are not to cast a ring
for the perfumed terms of the time, as <i>accommodation</i>,
<i>complement</i>, <i>spirit</i> &amp;c., but use them properly
in their place, as others.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>Vigor</i>&mdash;There followeth life and
quickness, which is the strength and sinews, as it were, of your
penning by pretty sayings, similitudes, and conceits; allusions
from known history, or other common-place, such as are in the
<i>Courtier</i>, and the second book of Cicero <i>De
Oratore</i>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>Discretio</i>.&mdash;The last is, respect to
discern what fits yourself, him to whom you write, and that which
you handle, which is a quality fit to conclude the rest, because
it doth include all.&nbsp; And that must proceed from ripeness of
judgment, which, as one truly saith, is gotten by four means,
God, nature, diligence, and conversation.&nbsp; Serve the first
well, and the rest will serve you.</p>
<p><i>De Poetica</i>.&mdash;We have spoken sufficiently of
oratory, let us now make a diversion to poetry.&nbsp; Poetry, in
the primogeniture, had many peccant humours, and is made to have
more now, through the levity and inconstancy of men&rsquo;s
judgments.&nbsp; Whereas, indeed, it is the most prevailing
eloquence, and of the most exalted caract.&nbsp; Now the
discredits and disgraces are many it hath received through
men&rsquo;s study of depravation or calumny; their practice being
to give it diminution of credit, by lessening the
professor&rsquo;s estimation, and making the age afraid of their
liberty; and the age is grown so tender of her fame, as she calls
all writings aspersions.</p>
<p>That is the state word, the phrase of court (placentia
college), which some call Parasites place, the Inn of
Ignorance.</p>
<p><i>D. Hieronymus</i>.&mdash;Whilst I name no persons, but
deride follies, why should any man confess or betray himself why
doth not that of S. Hierome come into their mind, <i>Ubi
generalis est de vitiis disputatio</i>, <i>ibi nullius esse
person&aelig; injuriam</i>? <a name="citation133a"></a><a
href="#footnote133a" class="citation">[133a]</a>&nbsp; Is it such
an inexpiable crime in poets to tax vices generally, and no
offence in them, who, by their exception confess they have
committed them particularly?&nbsp; Are we fallen into those times
that we must not&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Auriculas teneras mordaci rodere

<p><i>Remedii votum semper verius erat</i>, <i>quam spes</i>. <a
name="citation133c"></a><a href="#footnote133c"
class="citation">[133c]</a>&mdash;<i>Sexus
f&aelig;min</i>.&mdash;If men may by no means write freely, or
speak truth, but when it offends not, why do physicians cure with
sharp medicines, or corrosives? is not the same equally lawful in
the cure of the mind that is in the cure of the body?&nbsp; Some
vices, you will say, are so foul that it is better they should be
done than spoken.&nbsp; But they that take offence where no name,
character, or signature doth blazon them seem to me like affected
as women, who if they hear anything ill spoken of the ill of
their sex, are presently moved, as if the contumely respected
their particular; and on the contrary, when they hear good of
good women, conclude that it belongs to them all.&nbsp; If I see
anything that toucheth me, shall I come forth a betrayer of
myself presently?&nbsp; No, if I be wise, I&rsquo;ll dissemble
it; if honest, I&rsquo;ll avoid it, lest I publish that on my own
forehead which I saw there noted without a title.&nbsp; A man
that is on the mending hand will either ingenuously confess or
wisely dissemble his disease.&nbsp; And the wise and virtuous
will never think anything belongs to themselves that is written,
but rejoice that the good are warned not to be such; and the ill
to leave to be such.&nbsp; The person offended hath no reason to
be offended with the writer, but with himself; and so to declare
that properly to belong to him which was so spoken of all men, as
it could be no man&rsquo;s several, but his that would wilfully
and desperately claim it.&nbsp; It sufficeth I know what kind of
persons I displease, men bred in the declining and decay of
virtue, betrothed to their own vices; that have abandoned or
prostituted their good names; hungry and ambitious of infamy,
invested in all deformity, enthralled to ignorance and malice, of
a hidden and concealed malignity, and that hold a concomitancy
with all evil.</p>
<h3><i>What is a Poet</i>?</h3>
<p><i>Poeta</i>.&mdash;A poet is that which by the Greeks is
called &kappa;&alpha;&tau; &epsilon;&xi;&omicron;&chi;&eta;&nu;,
&omicron; &pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&tau;&#942;&sigmaf;, a maker,
or a feigner: his art, an art of imitation or feigning;
expressing the life of man in fit measure, numbers, and harmony,
according to Aristotle; from the word
&pi;&omicron;&iota;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;, which signifies to make
or feign.&nbsp; Hence he is called a poet, not he which writeth
in measure only, but that feigneth and formeth a fable, and
writes things like the truth.&nbsp; For the fable and fiction is,
as it were, the form and soul of any poetical work or poem.</p>
<h3><i>What mean</i>, <i>you by a Poem</i>?</h3>
<p><i>Poema</i>.&mdash;A poem is not alone any work or
composition of the poet&rsquo;s in many or few verses; but even
one verse alone sometimes makes a perfect poem.&nbsp; As when
&AElig;neas hangs up and consecrates the arms of Abas with this
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&AElig;neas h&aelig;c de Danais victoribus
arma.&rdquo; <a name="citation136a"></a><a href="#footnote136a"
class="citation">[136a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And calls it a poem or carmen.&nbsp; Such are those in
Martial:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Omnia, Castor, emis: sic fiet, ut omnia
vendas.&rdquo; <a name="citation136b"></a><a href="#footnote136b"
class="citation">[136b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pauper videri Cinna vult, et est
pauper.&rdquo; <a name="citation136c"></a><a href="#footnote136c"
class="citation">[136c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Horatius</i>.&mdash;<i>Lucretius</i>.&mdash;So were
Horace&rsquo;s odes called Carmina, his lyric songs.&nbsp; And
Lucretius designs a whole book in his sixth:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Quod in primo quoque carmine claret.&rdquo;
<a name="citation136d"></a><a href="#footnote136d"
class="citation">[136d]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Epicum</i>.&mdash;<i>Dramaticum</i>.&mdash;<i>Lyricum</i>.&mdash;<i>Elegiacum</i>.&mdash;<i>Epigrammat</i>.&mdash;And
anciently all the oracles were called Carmina; or whatever
sentence was expressed, were it much or little, it was called an
Epic, Dramatic, Lyric, Elegiac, or Epigrammatic poem.</p>
<h3><i>But how differs a Poem from what we call Poesy</i>?</h3>
<p><i>Poesis</i>.&mdash;<i>Artium regina</i>.&mdash;<i>Poet.
differenti&aelig;</i>.&mdash;<i>Grammatic</i>.&mdash;<i>Logic</i>.&mdash;<i>Rhetoric</i>.&mdash;<i>Ethica</i>.&mdash;A
poem, as I have told you, is the work of the poet; the end and
fruit of his labour and study.&nbsp; Poesy is his skill or craft
of making; the very fiction itself, the reason or form of the
work.&nbsp; And these three voices differ, as the thing done, the
doing, and the doer; the thing feigned, the feigning, and the
feigner; so the poem, the poesy, and the poet.&nbsp; Now the
poesy is the habit or the art; nay, rather the queen of arts,
which had her original from heaven, received thence from the
Hebrews, and had in prime estimation with the Greeks transmitted
to the Latins and all nations that professed civility.&nbsp; The
study of it (if we will trust Aristotle) offers to mankind a
certain rule and pattern of living well and happily, disposing us
to all civil offices of society.&nbsp; If we will believe Tully,
it nourisheth and instructeth our youth, delights our age, adorns
our prosperity, comforts our adversity, entertains us at home,
keeps us company abroad, travels with us, watches, divides the
times of our earnest and sports, shares in our country recesses
and recreations; insomuch as the wisest and best learned have
thought her the absolute mistress of manners and nearest of kin
to virtue.&nbsp; And whereas they entitle philosophy to be a
rigid and austere poesy, they have, on the contrary, styled poesy
a dulcet and gentle philosophy, which leads on and guides us by
the hand to action with a ravishing delight and incredible
sweetness.&nbsp; But before we handle the kinds of poems, with
their special differences, or make court to the art itself, as a
mistress, I would lead you to the knowledge of our poet by a
perfect information what he is or should be by nature, by
exercise, by imitation, by study, and so bring him down through
the disciplines of grammar, logic, rhetoric, and the ethics,
adding somewhat out of all, peculiar to himself, and worthy of
your admittance or reception.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;
<i>Ingenium</i>.&mdash;<i>Seneca</i>.&mdash;<i>Plato</i>.&mdash;<i>Aristotle</i>.&mdash;<i>Helicon</i>.&mdash;<i>Pegasus</i>.&mdash;<i>Parnassus</i>.&mdash;<i>Ovid</i>.&mdash;First,
we require in our poet or maker (for that title our language
affords him elegantly with the Greek) a goodness of natural
wit.&nbsp; For whereas all other arts consist of doctrine and
precepts, the poet must be able by nature and instinct to pour
out the treasure of his mind, and as Seneca saith, <i>Aliquando
secundum Anacreontem insanire jucundum esse</i>; by which he
understands the poetical rapture.&nbsp; And according to that of
Plato, <i>Frustr&agrave; poeticas fores sui compos
pulsavit</i>.&nbsp; And of Aristotle, <i>Nullum magnum ingenium
sine mixtur&acirc; dementi&aelig; fuit</i>.&nbsp; <i>Nec potest
grande aliquid</i>, <i>et supra c&aelig;teros loqui</i>, <i>nisi
mota mens</i>.&nbsp; Then it riseth higher, as by a divine
instinct, when it contemns common and known conceptions.&nbsp; It
utters somewhat above a mortal mouth.&nbsp; Then it gets aloft
and flies away with his rider, whither before it was doubtful to
ascend.&nbsp; This the poets understood by their Helicon,
Pegasus, or Parnassus; and this made Ovid to boast,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Est deus in nobis, agitante calescimus
illo<br />
Sedibus &aelig;thereis spiritus ille venit.&rdquo; <a
name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a"
class="citation">[139a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Lipsius</i>.&mdash;<i>Petron. in. Fragm</i>.&mdash;And
Lipsius to affirm, <i>Scio</i>, <i>poetam neminem
pr&aelig;stantem fuisse</i>, <i>sine parte quadam uberiore
divin&aelig; aur&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; And hence it is that the
coming up of good poets (for I mind not mediocres or imos) is so
thin and rare among us.&nbsp; Every beggarly corporation affords
the State a mayor or two bailiffs yearly; but <i>Solus rex</i>,
<i>aut poeta</i>, <i>non quotannis nascitur</i>.&nbsp; To this
perfection of nature in our poet we require exercise of those
parts, and frequent.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;
<i>Exercitatio</i>.&mdash;<i>Virgil</i>.&mdash;<i>Scaliger</i>.&mdash;<i>Valer.

Maximus</i>.&mdash;<i>Euripides</i>.&mdash;<i>Alcestis</i>.&mdash;If
his wit will not arrive suddenly at the dignity of the ancients,
let him not yet fall out with it, quarrel, or be over hastily
angry; offer to turn it away from study in a humour, but come to
it again upon better cogitation; try another time with
labour.&nbsp; If then it succeed not, cast not away the quills
yet, nor scratch the wainscot, beat not the poor desk, but bring
all to the forge and file again; torn it anew.&nbsp; There is no
statute law of the kingdom bids you be a poet against your will
or the first quarter; if it comes in a year or two, it is
well.&nbsp; The common rhymers pour forth verses, such as they
are, <i>ex tempore</i>; but there never comes from them one sense
worth the life of a day.&nbsp; A rhymer and a poet are two
things.&nbsp; It is said of the incomparable Virgil that he
brought forth his verses like a bear, and after formed them with
licking.&nbsp; Scaliger the father writes it of him, that he made
a quantity of verses in the morning, which afore night he reduced
to a less number.&nbsp; But that which Valerius Maximus hath left
recorded of Euripides, the tragic poet, his answer to Alcestis,
another poet, is as memorable as modest; who, when it was told to
Alcestis that Euripides had in three days brought forth but three
verses, and those with some difficulty and throes, Alcestis,
glorying he could with ease have sent forth a hundred in the
space, Euripides roundly replied, &ldquo;Like enough; but here is
the difference: thy verses will not last these three days, mine
will to all time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which was as much as to tell him
he could not write a verse.&nbsp; I have met many of these
rattles that made a noise and buzzed.&nbsp; They had their hum,
and no more.&nbsp; Indeed, things wrote with labour deserve to be
so read, and will last their age.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;
<i>Imitatio</i>.&mdash;<i>Horatius</i>.&mdash;<i>Virgil</i>.&mdash;<i>Statius</i>.&mdash;<i>Homer</i>.&mdash;<i>Horat</i>.&mdash;<i>Archil</i>.&mdash;<i>Alc&aelig;us</i>,
&amp;c.&mdash;The third requisite in our poet or maker is
imitation, to be able to convert the substance or riches of
another poet to his own use.&nbsp; To make choice of one
excellent man above the rest, and so to follow him till he grow
very he, or so like him as the copy may be mistaken for the
principal.&nbsp; Not as a creature that swallows what it takes in
crude, raw, or undigested, but that feeds with an appetite, and
hath a stomach to concoct, divide, and turn all into
nourishment.&nbsp; Not to imitate servilely, as Horace saith, and
catch at vices for virtue, but to draw forth out of the best and
choicest flowers, with the bee, and turn all into honey, work it
into one relish and savour; make our imitation sweet; observe how
the best writers have imitated, and follow them.&nbsp; How Virgil
and Statius have imitated Homer; how Horace, Archilochus; how
Alc&aelig;us, and the other lyrics; and so of the rest.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;
<i>Lectio</i>.&mdash;<i>Parnassus</i>.&mdash;<i>Helicon</i>.&mdash;<i>Arscoron</i>.&mdash;<i>M.
T.
Cicero</i>.&mdash;<i>Simylus</i>.&mdash;<i>Stob</i>.&mdash;<i>Horat</i>.&mdash;<i>Aristot</i>.&mdash;But
that which we especially require in him is an exactness of study
and multiplicity of reading, which maketh a full man, not alone
enabling him to know the history or argument of a poem and to
report it, but so to master the matter and style, as to show he
knows how to handle, place, or dispose of either with elegancy
when need shall be.&nbsp; And not think he can leap forth
suddenly a poet by dreaming he hath been in Parnassus, or having
washed his lips, as they say, in Helicon.&nbsp; There goes more
to his making than so; for to nature, exercise, imitation, and
study art must be added to make all these perfect.&nbsp; And
though these challenge to themselves much in the making up of our
maker, it is Art only can lead him to perfection, and leave him
there in possession, as planted by her hand.&nbsp; It is the
assertion of Tully, if to an excellent nature there happen an
accession or conformation of learning and discipline, there will
then remain somewhat noble and singular.&nbsp; For, as Simylus
saith in Stob&aelig;us, &Omicron;&upsilon;&tau;&epsilon;
&phi;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; &#943;&kappa;&alpha;&nu;&eta;
y&iota;&nu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;
&tau;&epsilon;&chi;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf; &alpha;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;,
&omicron;&upsilon;&tau;&epsilon; &pi;&alpha;&nu;
&tau;&#941;&chi;&nu;&eta; &mu;&eta;
&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&nu;
&kappa;&epsilon;&kappa;&tau;&eta;&mu;&#941;&nu;&eta;, without art
nature can never be perfect; and without nature art can claim no
being.&nbsp; But our poet must beware that his study be not only
to learn of himself; for he that shall affect to do that
confesseth his ever having a fool to his master.&nbsp; He must
read many, but ever the best and choicest; those that can teach
him anything he must ever account his masters, and
reverence.&nbsp; Among whom Horace and (he that taught him)
Aristotle deserved to be the first in estimation.&nbsp; Aristotle
was the first accurate critic and truest judge&mdash;nay, the
greatest philosopher the world ever had&mdash;for he noted the
vices of all knowledges in all creatures, and out of many
men&rsquo;s perfections in a science he formed still one
art.&nbsp; So he taught us two offices together, how we ought to
judge rightly of others, and what we ought to imitate specially
in ourselves.&nbsp; But all this in vain without a natural wit
and a poetical nature in chief.&nbsp; For no man, so soon as he
knows this or reads it, shall be able to write the better; but as
he is adapted to it by nature, he shall grow the perfecter
writer.&nbsp; He must have civil prudence and eloquence, and that
whole; not taken up by snatches or pieces in sentences or
remnants when he will handle business or carry counsels, as if he
came then out of the declaimer&rsquo;s gallery, or shadow
furnished but out of the body of the State, which commonly is the
school of men.</p>
<p><i>Virorum schola
respub</i>.&mdash;<i>Lysippus</i>.&mdash;<i>Apelles</i>.&mdash;<i>N&aelig;vius</i>.&mdash;The
poet is the nearest borderer upon the orator, and expresseth all
his virtues, though he be tied more to numbers, is his equal in
ornament, and above him in his strengths.&nbsp; And (of the kind)
the comic comes nearest; because in moving the minds of men, and
stirring of affections (in which oratory shows, and especially
approves her eminence), he chiefly excels.&nbsp; What figure of a
body was Lysippus ever able to form with his graver, or Apelles
to paint with his pencil, as the comedy to life expresseth so
many and various affections of the mind?&nbsp; There shall the
spectator see some insulting with joy, others fretting with
melancholy, raging with anger, mad with love, boiling with
avarice, undone with riot, tortured with expectation, consumed
with fear; no perturbation in common life but the orator finds an
example of it in the scene.&nbsp; And then for the elegancy of
language, read but this inscription on the grave of a comic
poet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Immortales mortales si fas esset fiere,<br
/>
Flerent div&aelig; Cam&oelig;n&aelig; N&aelig;vium poetam;<br />
Itaque postquam est Orcino traditus thesauro,<br />
Obliti sunt Rom&aelig; lingu&acirc; loqui Latin&acirc;.&rdquo; <a
name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a"
class="citation">[146a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>L. &AElig;lius Stilo</i>.&mdash;<i>Plautus</i>.&mdash;<i>M.
Varro</i>.&mdash;Or that modester testimony given by Lucius
&AElig;lius Stilo upon Plautus, who affirmed,
&ldquo;<i>Musas</i>, <i>si Latin&egrave; loqui voluissent</i>,
<i>Plautino sermone fuisse loquuturas</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that
illustrious judgment by the most learned M. Varro of him, who
pronounced him the prince of letters and elegancy in the Roman
language.</p>
<p><i>Sophocles</i>.&mdash;I am not of that opinion to conclude a
poet&rsquo;s liberty within the narrow limits of laws which
either the grammarians or philosophers prescribe.&nbsp; For
before they found out those laws there were many excellent poets
that fulfilled them, amongst whom none more perfect than
Sophocles, who lived a little before Aristotle.</p>

<p><i>Demosthenes</i>.&mdash;<i>Pericles</i>.&mdash;<i>Alcibiades</i>.&mdash;Which
of the Greeklings durst ever give precepts to Demosthenes? or to
Pericles, whom the age surnamed Heavenly, because he seemed to
thunder and lighten with his language? or to Alcibiades, who had
rather Nature for his guide than Art for his master?</p>
<p><i>Aristotle</i>.&mdash;But whatsoever nature at any time
dictated to the most happy, or long exercise to the most
laborious, that the wisdom and learning of Aristotle hath brought
into an art, because he understood the causes of things; and what
other men did by chance or custom he doth by reason; and not only
found out the way not to err, but the short way we should take
not to err.</p>
<p><i>Euripides</i>.&mdash;<i>Aristophanes</i>.&mdash;Many things
in Euripides hath Aristophanes wittily reprehended, not out of
art, but out of truth.&nbsp; For Euripides is sometimes peccant,
as he is most times perfect.&nbsp; But judgment when it is
greatest, if reason doth not accompany it, is not ever
absolute.</p>
<p><i>Cens. Scal. in Lil. Germ</i>.&mdash;<i>Horace</i>.&mdash;To
judge of poets is only the faculty of poets; and not of all
poets, but the best.&nbsp; <i>Nemo infelici&ugrave;s de poetis
judicavit</i>, <i>qu&agrave;m qui de poetis scripsit</i>. <a
name="citation148a"></a><a href="#footnote148a"
class="citation">[148a]</a>&nbsp; But some will say critics are a
kind of tinkers, that make more faults than they mend
ordinarily.&nbsp; See their diseases and those of
grammarians.&nbsp; It is true, many bodies are the worse for the
meddling with; and the multitude of physicians hath destroyed
many sound patients with their wrong practice.&nbsp; But the
office of a true critic or censor is, not to throw by a letter
anywhere, or damn an innocent syllable, but lay the words
together, and amend them; judge sincerely of the author and his
matter, which is the sign of solid and perfect learning in a
man.&nbsp; Such was Horace, an author of much civility, and (if
any one among the heathen can be) the best master both of virtue
and wisdom; an excellent and true judge upon cause and reason,
not because he thought so, but because he knew so out of use and
experience.</p>

<p>But chiefly his opinion of Plautus <a
name="citation149e"></a><a href="#footnote149e"
class="citation">[149e]</a> vindicated against many that are
offended, and say it is a hard censure upon the parent of all
conceit and sharpness.&nbsp; And they wish it had not fallen from
so great a master and censor in the art, whose bondmen knew
better how to judge of Plautus than any that dare patronise the
family of learning in this age; who could not be ignorant of the
judgment of the times in which he lived, when poetry and the
Latin language were at the height; especially being a man so
conversant and inwardly familiar with the censures of great men
that did discourse of these things daily amongst
themselves.&nbsp; Again, a man so gracious and in high favour
with the Emperor, as Augustus often called him his witty manling
(for the littleness of his stature), and, if we may trust
antiquity, had designed him for a secretary of estate, and
invited him to the palace, which he modestly prayed off and
refused.</p>
<p><i>Terence</i>.&mdash;<i>Menander</i>.&nbsp; Horace did so
highly esteem Terence&rsquo;s comedies, as he ascribes the art in
comedy to him alone among the Latins, and joins him with
Menander.</p>
<p>Now, let us see what may be said for either, to defend
Horace&rsquo;s judgment to posterity and not wholly to condemn
Plautus.</p>
<p><i>The parts of a comedy and tragedy</i>.&mdash;The parts of a
comedy are the same with a tragedy, and the end is partly the
same, for they both delight and teach; the comics are called
&delta;&iota;&delta;&#940;&sigma;&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;,
of the Greeks no less than the tragics.</p>

<p><i>Aristotle</i>.&mdash;<i>Plato</i>.&mdash;<i>Homer</i>.&mdash;Nor
is the moving of laughter always the end of comedy; that is
rather a fowling for the people&rsquo;s delight, or their
fooling.&nbsp; For, as Aristotle says rightly, the moving of
laughter is a fault in comedy, a kind of turpitude that depraves
some part of a man&rsquo;s nature without a disease.&nbsp; As a
wry face without pain moves laughter, or a deformed vizard, or a
rude clown dressed in a lady&rsquo;s habit and using her actions;
we dislike and scorn such representations which made the ancient
philosophers ever think laughter unfitting in a wise man.&nbsp;
And this induced Plato to esteem of Homer as a sacrilegious
person, because he presented the gods sometimes laughing.&nbsp;
As also it is divinely said of Aristotle, that to seen ridiculous
is a part of dishonesty, and foolish.</p>
<p><i>The wit of the old comedy</i>.&mdash;So that what either in
the words or sense of an author, or in the language or actions of
men, is awry or depraved does strangely stir mean affections, and
provoke for the most part to laughter.&nbsp; And therefore it was
clear that all insolent and obscene speeches, jests upon the best
men, injuries to particular persons, perverse and sinister
sayings (and the rather unexpected) in the old comedy did move
laughter, especially where it did imitate any dishonesty, and
scurrility came forth in the place of wit, which, who understands
the nature and genius of laughter cannot but perfectly know.</p>
<p><i>Aristophanes</i>.&mdash;<i>Plautus</i>.&mdash;Of which
Aristophanes affords an ample harvest, having not only outgone
Plautus or any other in that kind, but expressed all the moods
and figures of what is ridiculous oddly.&nbsp; In short, as
vinegar is not accounted good until the wine be corrupted, so
jests that are true and natural seldom raise laughter with the
beast the multitude.&nbsp; They love nothing that is right and
proper.&nbsp; The farther it runs from reason or possibility with
them the better it is.</p>
<p><i>Socrates</i>.&mdash;<i>Theatrical wit</i>.&mdash;What could
have made them laugh, like to see Socrates presented, that
example of all good life, honesty, and virtue, to have him
hoisted up with a pulley, and there play the philosopher in a
basket; measure how many foot a flea could skip geometrically, by
a just scale, and edify the people from the engine.&nbsp; This
was theatrical wit, right stage jesting, and relishing a
playhouse, invented for scorn and laughter; whereas, if it had
savoured of equity, truth, perspicuity, and candour, to have
tasten a wise or a learned palate,&mdash;spit it out presently!
this is bitter and profitable: this instructs and would inform
us: what need we know any thing, that are nobly born, more than a
horse-race, or a hunting-match, our day to break with citizens,
and such innate mysteries?</p>
<p><i>The cart</i>.&mdash;This is truly leaping from the stage to
the tumbril again, reducing all wit to the original
dung-cart.</p>
<h3>Of the magnitude and compass of any fable, epic or
dramatic.</h3>
<p><i>What the measure of a fable is</i>.&mdash;<i>The fable or
plot of a poem defined</i>.&mdash;<i>The epic fable</i>,
<i>differing from the dramatic</i>.&mdash;To the resolving of
this question we must first agree in the definition of the
fable.&nbsp; The fable is called the imitation of one entire and
perfect action, whose parts are so joined and knit together, as
nothing in the structure can be changed, or taken away, without
impairing or troubling the whole, of which there is a
proportionable magnitude in the members.&nbsp; As for example: if
a man would build a house, he would first appoint a place to
build it in, which he would define within certain bounds; so in
the constitution of a poem, the action is aimed at by the poet,
which answers place in a building, and that action hath his
largeness, compass, and proportion.&nbsp; But as a court or
king&rsquo;s palace requires other dimensions than a private
house, so the epic asks a magnitude from other poems, since what
is place in the one is action in the other; the difference is an
space.&nbsp; So that by this definition we conclude the fable to
be the imitation of one perfect and entire action, as one perfect
and entire place is required to a building.&nbsp; By perfect, we
understand that to which nothing is wanting, as place to the
building that is raised, and action to the fable that is
formed.&nbsp; It is perfect, perhaps not for a court or
king&rsquo;s palace, which requires a greater ground, but for the
structure he would raise; so the space of the action may not
prove large enough for the epic fable, yet be perfect for the
dramatic, and whole.</p>
<p><i>What we understand by whole</i>.&mdash;Whole we call that,
and perfect, which hath a beginning, a midst, and an end.&nbsp;
So the place of any building may be whole and entire for that
work, though too little for a palace.&nbsp; As to a tragedy or a
comedy, the action may be convenient and perfect that would not
fit an epic poem in magnitude.&nbsp; So a lion is a perfect
creature in himself, though it be less than that of a buffalo or
a rhinocerote.&nbsp; They differ but in specie: either in the
kind is absolute; both have their parts, and either the
whole.&nbsp; Therefore, as in every body so in every action,
which is the subject of a just work, there is required a certain
proportionable greatness, neither too vast nor too minute.&nbsp;
For that which happens to the eyes when we behold a body, the
same happens to the memory when we contemplate an action.&nbsp; I
look upon a monstrous giant, as Tityus, whose body covered nine
acres of land, and mine eye sticks upon every part; the whole
that consists of those parts will never be taken in at one entire
view.&nbsp; So in a fable, if the action be too great, we can
never comprehend the whole together in our imagination.&nbsp;
Again, if it be too little, there ariseth no pleasure out of the
object; it affords the view no stay; it is beheld, and vanisheth
at once.&nbsp; As if we should look upon an ant or pismire, the
parts fly the sight, and the whole considered is almost
nothing.&nbsp; The same happens in action, which is the object of
memory, as the body is of sight.&nbsp; Too vast oppresseth the
eyes, and exceeds the memory; too little scarce admits
either.</p>
<p><i>What is the utmost bounds of a fable</i>.&mdash;Now in
every action it behoves the poet to know which is his utmost
bound, how far with fitness and a necessary proportion he may
produce and determine it; that is, till either good fortune
change into the worse, or the worse into the better.&nbsp; For as
a body without proportion cannot be goodly, no more can the
action, either in comedy or tragedy, without his fit bounds: and
every bound, for the nature of the subject, is esteemed the best
that is largest, till it can increase no more; so it behoves the
action in tragedy or comedy to be let grow till the necessity ask
a conclusion; wherein two things are to be considered: first,
that it exceed not the compass of one day; next, that there be
place left for digression and art.&nbsp; For the episodes and
digressions in a fable are the same that household stuff and
other furniture are in a house.&nbsp; And so far from the measure
and extent of a fable dramatic.</p>
<p><i>What by one and entire</i>.&mdash;Now that it should be one
and entire.&nbsp; One is considerable two ways; either as it is
only separate, and by itself, or as being composed of many parts,
it begins to be one as those parts grow or are wrought
together.&nbsp; That it should be one the first away alone, and
by itself, no man that hath tasted letters ever would say,
especially having required before a just magnitude and equal
proportion of the parts in themselves.&nbsp; Neither of which can
possibly be, if the action be single and separate, not composed
of parts, which laid together in themselves, with an equal and
fitting proportion, tend to the same end; which thing out of
antiquity itself hath deceived many, and more this day it doth
deceive.</p>

<p><i>Hercules</i>.&mdash;<i>Theseus</i>.&mdash;<i>Achilles</i>.&mdash;<i>Ulysses</i>.&mdash;<i>Homer
and
Virgil</i>.&mdash;<i>&AElig;neas</i>.&mdash;<i>Venus</i>.&mdash;So
many there be of old that have thought the action of one man to
be one, as of Hercules, Theseus, Achilles, Ulysses, and other
heroes; which is both foolish and false, since by one and the
same person many things may be severally done which cannot fitly
be referred or joined to the same end: which not only the
excellent tragic poets, but the best masters of the epic, Homer
and Virgil, saw.&nbsp; For though the argument of an epic poem be
far more diffused and poured out than that of tragedy, yet
Virgil, writing of &AElig;neas, hath pretermitted many
things.&nbsp; He neither tells how he was born, how brought up,
how he fought with Achilles, how he was snatched out of the
battle by Venus; but that one thing, how he came into Italy, he
prosecutes in twelve books.&nbsp; The rest of his journey, his
error by sea, the sack of Troy, are put not as the argument of
the work, but episodes of the argument.&nbsp; So Homer laid by
many things of Ulysses, and handled no more than he saw tended to
one and the same end.</p>

<p><i>Theseus</i>.&mdash;<i>Hercules</i>.&mdash;<i>Juvenal</i>.&mdash;<i>Codrus</i>.&mdash;<i>Sophocles</i>.&mdash;<i>Ajax</i>.&mdash;<i>Ulysses</i>.&mdash;Contrary
to which, and foolishly, those poets did, whom the philosopher
taxeth, of whom one gathered all the actions of Theseus, another
put all the labours of Hercules in one work.&nbsp; So did he whom
Juvenal mentions in the beginning, &ldquo;hoarse Codrus,&rdquo;
that recited a volume compiled, which he called his Theseide, not
yet finished, to the great trouble both of his hearers and
himself; amongst which there were many parts had no coherence nor
kindred one with another, so far they were from being one action,
one fable.&nbsp; For as a house, consisting of divers materials,
becomes one structure and one dwelling, so an action, composed of
divers parts, may become one fable, epic or dramatic.&nbsp; For
example, in a tragedy, look upon Sophocles, his Ajax: Ajax,
deprived of Achilles&rsquo; armour, which he hoped from the
suffrage of the Greeks, disdains; and, growing impatient of the
injury, rageth, and runs mad.&nbsp; In that humour he doth many
senseless things, and at last falls upon the Grecian flock and
kills a great ram for Ulysses: returning to his senses, he grows
ashamed of the scorn, and kills himself; and is by the chiefs of
the Greeks forbidden burial.&nbsp; These things agree and hang
together, not as they were done, but as seeming to be done, which
made the action whole, entire, and absolute.</p>
<p><i>The conclusion concerning the whole</i>, <i>and the
parts</i>.&mdash;<i>Which are episodes</i>.&mdash;<i>Ajax and
Hector</i>.&mdash;<i>Homer</i>.&mdash;For the whole, as it
consisteth of parts, so without all the parts it is not the
whole; and to make it absolute is required not only the parts,
but such parts as are true.&nbsp; For a part of the whole was
true; which, if you take away, you either change the whole or it
is not the whole.&nbsp; For if it be such a part, as, being
present or absent, nothing concerns the whole, it cannot be
called a part of the whole; and such are the episodes, of which
hereafter.&nbsp; For the present here is one example: the single
combat of Ajax with Hector, as it is at large described in Homer,
nothing belongs to this Ajax of Sophocles.</p>
<p>You admire no poems but such as run like a brewer&rsquo;s cart
upon the stones, hobbling:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Et, qu&aelig; per salebras, altaque saxa
cadunt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Accius et quidquid Pacuviusque vomunt.<br />
Attonitusque legis terra&iuml;, frugifera&iuml;.&rdquo; <a

<h2>SOME POEMS.</h2>
<h3>TO WILLIAM CAMDEN.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Camden</span>! most
reverend head, to whom I owe<br />
All that I am in arts, all that I know&mdash;<br />
How nothing&rsquo;s that! to whom my country owes<br />
The great renown, and name wherewith she goes!<br />
Than thee the age sees not that thing more grave,<br />
More high, more holy, that she more would crave.<br />
What name, what skill, what faith hast thou in things!<br />
What sight in searching the most antique springs!<br />
What weight, and what authority in thy speech!<br />
Men scarce can make that doubt, but thou canst teach.<br />
Pardon free truth, and let thy modesty,<br />
Which conquers all, be once o&rsquo;ercome by thee.<br />
Many of thine, this better could, than I;<br />
But for their powers, accept my piety.</p>
<h3>ON MY FIRST DAUGHTER.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Here</span> lies, to each
her parents&rsquo; ruth,<br />
Mary, the daughter of their youth;<br />
Yet, all heaven&rsquo;s gifts, being heaven&rsquo;s due,<br />
It makes the father less to rue.<br />
At six months&rsquo; end, she parted hence,<br />
With safety of her innocence;<br />
Whose soul heaven&rsquo;s queen, whose name she bears,<br />
In comfort of her mother&rsquo;s tears,<br />
Hath placed amongst her virgin-train;<br />
Where, while that severed doth remain,<br />
This grave partakes the fleshly birth;<br />
Which cover lightly, gentle earth!</p>
<h3>ON MY FIRST SON.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Farewell</span>, thou child
of my right hand, and joy;<br />
My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy;<br />
Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,<br />
Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.<br />
Oh! could I lose all father, now! for why,<br />
Will man lament the state he should envy?<br />
To have so soon &rsquo;scaped world&rsquo;s, and flesh&rsquo;s
rage,<br />
And, if no other misery, yet age!<br />
Rest in soft peace, and, asked, say here doth lie<br />
Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry;<br />
For whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such,<br />
As what he loves may never like too much.</p>
<h3>TO FRANCIS BEAUMONT.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">How</span> I do love thee,
Beaumont, and thy muse,<br />
That unto me dost such religion use!<br />
How I do fear myself, that am not worth<br />
The least indulgent thought thy pen drops forth!<br />
At once thou mak&rsquo;st me happy, and unmak&rsquo;st;<br />
And giving largely to me, more thou takest!<br />
What fate is mine, that so itself bereaves?<br />
What art is thine, that so thy friend deceives?<br />
When even there, where most thou praisest me,<br />
For writing better, I must envy thee.</p>
<h3>OF LIFE AND DEATH.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> ports of death
are sins; of life, good deeds:<br />
Through which our merit leads us to our meeds.<br />
How wilful blind is he, then, that would stray,<br />
And hath it in his powers to make his way!<br />
This world death&rsquo;s region is, the other life&rsquo;s:<br />
And here it should be one of our first strifes,<br />
So to front death, as men might judge us past it:<br />
For good men but see death, the wicked taste it.</p>
<h3>INVITING A FRIEND TO SUPPER.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">To-night</span>, grave sir,
both my poor house and I<br />
Do equally desire your company;<br />
Not that we think us worthy such a guest,<br />
But that your worth will dignify our feast,<br />
With those that come; whose grace may make that seem<br />
Something, which else could hope for no esteem.<br />
It is the fair acceptance, sir, creates<br />
The entertainment perfect, not the cates.<br />
Yet shall you have, to rectify your palate,<br />
An olive, capers, or some bitter salad<br />
Ushering the mutton; with a short-legged hen,<br />
If we can get her, full of eggs, and then,<br />
Lemons and wine for sauce: to these, a coney<br />
Is not to be despaired of for our money;<br />
And though fowl now be scarce, yet there are clerks,<br />
The sky not falling, think we may have larks.<br />
I&rsquo;ll tell you of more, and lie, so you will come:<br />
Of partridge, pheasant, woodcock, of which some<br />
May yet be there; and godwit if we can;<br />
Knat, rail, and ruff, too.&nbsp; Howsoe&rsquo;er, my man<br />
Shall read a piece of Virgil, Tacitus,<br />
Livy, or of some better book to us,<br />
Of which we&rsquo;ll speak our minds, amidst our meat;<br />
And I&rsquo;ll profess no verses to repeat:<br />
To this if aught appear, which I not know of,<br />
That will the pastry, not my paper, show of.<br />
Digestive cheese, and fruit there sure will be;<br />
But that which most doth take my muse and me,<br />
Is a pure cup of rich canary wine,<br />
Which is the Mermaid&rsquo;s now, but shall be mine:<br />
Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted,<br />
Their lives, as do their lines, till now had lasted.<br />
Tobacco, nectar, or the Thespian spring,<br />
Are all but Luther&rsquo;s beer, to this I sing.<br />
Of this we will sup free, but moderately,<br />
And we will have no Pooly&rsquo; or Parrot by;<br />
Nor shall our cups make any guilty men;<br />
But at our parting we will be as when<br />
We innocently met.&nbsp; No simple word<br />
That shall be uttered at our mirthful board,<br />
Shall make us sad next morning; or affright<br />
The liberty that we&rsquo;ll enjoy to-night.</p>
<h3>EPITAPH ON SALATHIEL PAVY,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A CHILD OF QUEEN ELIZABETH&rsquo;S
CHAPEL.</span></h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Weep</span> with me all you
that read<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This little story;<br />
And know for whom a tear you shed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Death&rsquo;s self is sorry.<br />
&rsquo;Twas a child that so did thrive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In grace and feature,<br />
As heaven and nature seemed to strive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which owned the creature.<br />
Years he numbered scarce thirteen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When fates turned cruel;<br />
Yet three filled zodiacs had he been<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stage&rsquo;s jewel;<br />
And did act, what now we moan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Old men so duly;<br />
As, sooth, the Parc&aelig; thought him one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He played so truly.<br />
So, by error to his fate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They all consented;<br />
But viewing him since, alas, too late!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They have repented;<br />
And have sought to give new birth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In baths to steep him;<br />
But, being so much too good for earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven vows to keep him.</p>
<h3>EPITAPH ON ELIZABETH, L. H.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Wouldst</span> thou hear
what man can say<br />
In a little?&nbsp; Reader, stay.<br />
Underneath this stone doth lie<br />
As much beauty as could die<br />
Which in life did harbour give<br />
To more virtue than doth live.<br />
If, at all, she had a fault<br />
Leave it buried in this vault.<br />
One name was Elizabeth,<br />
The other let it sleep with death.<br />
Fitter, where it died, to tell,<br />
Than that it lived at all.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>
<h3>EPITAPH ON THE COUNTESS OF PEMBROKE.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Underneath</span> this
sable hearse<br />
Lies the subject of all verse,<br />
Sidney&rsquo;s sister, Pembroke&rsquo;s mother:<br />
Death! ere thou hast slain another,<br />
Learned, and fair, and good as she,<br />
Time shall throw a dart at thee.</p>
<h3>TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED MASTER WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE, AND
WHAT HE HATH LEFT US.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">To</span> draw no envy,
Shakspeare, on thy name,<br />
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;<br />
While I confess thy writings to be such,<br />
As neither man, nor muse can praise too much.<br />
&rsquo;Tis true, and all men&rsquo;s suffrage.&nbsp; But these
ways<br />
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;<br />
For silliest ignorance on these may light,<br />
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;<br />
Or blind affection, which doth ne&rsquo;er advance<br />
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;<br />
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,<br />
And think to ruin, where it seemed to raise.<br />
These are, as some infamous bawd, or whore,<br />
Should praise a matron; what would hurt her more?<br />
But thou art proof against them, and, indeed,<br />
Above the ill-fortune of them, or the need.<br />
I, therefore, will begin: Soul of the age!<br />
The applause! delight! and wonder of our stage!<br />
My Shakspeare rise!&nbsp; I will not lodge thee by<br />
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie<br />
A little further off, to make thee room:<br />
Thou art a monument without a tomb,<br />
And art alive still, while thy book doth live<br />
And we have wits to read, and praise to give.<br />
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,<br />
I mean with great, but disproportioned Muses;<br />
For if I thought my judgment were of years,<br />
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,<br />
And tell how far thou didst our Lily outshine,<br />
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlow&rsquo;s mighty line.<br />
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,<br />
From thence to honour thee, I will not seek<br />
For names: but call forth thundering Eschylus,<br />
Euripides, and Sophocles to us,<br />
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordoua dead,<br />
To live again, to hear thy buskin tread,<br />
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,<br />
Leave thee alone for the comparison<br />
Of all that insolent Greece, or haughty Rome<br />
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.<br />
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show,<br />
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.<br />
He was not of an age, but for all time!<br />
And all the Muses still were in their prime,<br />
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm<br />
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!<br />
Nature herself was proud of his designs,<br />
And joyed to wear the dressing of his lines!<br />
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit,<br />
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.<br />
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes,<br />
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please;<br />
But antiquated and deserted lie,<br />
As they were not of nature&rsquo;s family.<br />
Yet must I not give nature all; thy art,<br />
My gentle Shakspeare, must enjoy a part.<br />
For though the poet&rsquo;s matter nature be,<br />
His heart doth give the fashion: and, that he<br />
Who casts to write a living line, must sweat,<br />
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat<br />
Upon the Muse&rsquo;s anvil; turn the same,<br />
And himself with it, that he thinks to frame;<br />
Or for the laurel, he may gain a scorn;<br />
For a good poet&rsquo;s made, as well as born.<br />
And such wert thou!&nbsp; Look how the father&rsquo;s face<br />
Lives in his issue, even so the race<br />
Of Shakspeare&rsquo;s mind and manners brightly shines<br />
In his well-turn&egrave;d, and true fil&egrave;d lines;<br />
In each of which he seems to shake a lance,<br />
As brandished at the eyes of ignorance.<br />
Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were<br />
To see thee in our water yet appear,<br />
And make those flights upon the banks of Thames,<br />
That so did take Eliza, and our James!<br />
But stay, I see thee in the hemisphere<br />
Advanced, and made a constellation there!<br />
Shine forth, thou star of poets, and with rage,<br />
Or influence, chide, or cheer the drooping stage,<br />
Which, since thy flight from hence, hath mourned like night,<br
/>
And despairs day, but for thy volume&rsquo;s light.</p>
<h3>TO CELIA.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Drink</span> to me only
with thine eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will pledge with mine;<br />
Or leave a kiss but in the cup,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll not look for wine.<br />
The thirst that from the soul doth rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth ask a drink divine:<br />
But might I of Jove&rsquo;s nectar sup,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not change for thine.</p>
<p class="poetry">I sent thee late a rosy wreath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not so much honouring thee,<br />
As giving it a hope that there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It could not withered be.<br />
But thou thereon didst only breathe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sent&rsquo;st it back to me:<br />
Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not of itself, but thee.</p>
<h3>THE TRIUMPH OF CHARIS.</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">See</span> the chariot at hand here of Love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein my lady rideth!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each that draws is a swan or a dove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And well the car Love guideth.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As she goes, all hearts do duty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto her
beauty;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, enamoured, do wish, so they might<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But enjoy such a
sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That they still were to run by her side,<br />
Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do but look on her eyes, they
do light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that Love&rsquo;s world
compriseth!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do but look on her hair, it is bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Love&rsquo;s star when it
riseth!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do but mark, her forehead&rsquo;s smoother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than words that
soothe her!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from her arched brows, such a grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheds itself
through the face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As alone there triumphs to the life<br />
All the gain, all the good, of the elements&rsquo; strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you seen but a bright
lily grow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before rude hands have touched
it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you marked but the fall o&rsquo; the snow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the soil hath smutched
it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you felt the wool of beaver?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or swan&rsquo;s
down ever?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or have smelt o&rsquo; the bud o&rsquo; the
brier?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the nard in
the fire?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or have tasted the bag of the bee?<br />
O so white!&nbsp; O so soft!&nbsp; O so sweet is she!</p>
<h3>IN THE PERSON OF WOMANKIND.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A SONG APOLOGETIC.</span></h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Men</span>, if you love us,
play no more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fools or tyrants with your friends,<br />
To make us still sing o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our own false praises, for your ends:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have both wits and fancies
too,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, if we must, let&rsquo;s sing
of you.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor do we doubt but that we can,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If we would search with care and pain,<br />
Find some one good in some one man;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So going thorough all your strain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall, at last, of parcels
make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One good enough for a song&rsquo;s
sake.</p>
<p class="poetry">And as a cunning painter takes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In any curious piece you see,<br />
More pleasure while the thing he makes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than when &rsquo;tis made&mdash;why so will we.<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And having pleased our art,
we&rsquo;ll try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make a new, and hang that
by.</p>
<h3>ODE</h3>
<p><i>To the Immortal Memory and Friendship of that Noble
Pair</i>, <i>Sir Lucius Cary and Sir Henry Morison</i>.</p>
<h4>I.</h4>
<h5>THE TURN.</h5>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Brave</span> infant of Saguntum, clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy coming forth in that great year,<br />
When the prodigious Hannibal did crown<br />
His cage, with razing your immortal town.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou, looking then about,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere thou wert half got out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wise child, didst hastily return,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mad&rsquo;st thy mother&rsquo;s womb thine
urn.<br />
How summed a circle didst thou leave mankind<br />
Of deepest lore, could we the centre find!</p>
<h5>THE COUNTER-TURN.</h5>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did wiser nature draw thee
back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From out the horror of that sack,<br />
Where shame, faith, honour, and regard of right,<br />
Lay trampled on? the deeds of death and night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urged, hurried forth, and
hurled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon th&rsquo; affrighted
world;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sword, fire, and famine, with fell fury met,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all on utmost ruin set;<br />
As, could they but life&rsquo;s miseries foresee,<br />
No doubt all infants would return like thee.</p>
<h5>THE STAND.</h5>
<p class="poetry">For what is life, if measured by the space<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not by the act?<br />
Or mask&egrave;d man, if valued by his face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above his fact?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s one outlived his peers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And told forth fourscore years;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He vex&egrave;d time, and busied the whole state;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Troubled both foes and friends;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But ever to no ends:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What did this stirrer but die late?<br />
How well at twenty had he fallen or stood!<br />
For three of his fourscore he did no good.</p>
<h4>II.</h4>
<h5>THE TURN</h5>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered well, by virtuous
parts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Got up, and thrived with honest arts;<br />
He purchased friends, and fame, and honours then,<br />
And had his noble name advanced with men:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But weary of that flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stooped in all men&rsquo;s
sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sordid
flatteries, acts of strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sunk in that
dead sea of life,<br />
So deep, as he did then death&rsquo;s waters sup,<br />
But that the cork of title buoyed him up.</p>
<h5>THE COUNTER-TURN</h5>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! but Morison fell
young:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He never fell,&mdash;thou fall&rsquo;st, my
tongue.<br />
He stood a soldier to the last right end,<br />
A perfect patriot, and a noble friend;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But most, a virtuous son.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All offices were done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By him, so ample, full, and round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In weight, in measure, number, sound,<br />
As, though his age imperfect might appear,<br />
His life was of humanity the sphere.</p>
<h5>THE STAND</h5>
<p class="poetry">Go now, and tell out days summed up with
fears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And make them years;<br />
Produce thy mass of miseries on the stage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To swell thine age;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat of things a throng,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To show thou hast been long,<br />
Not lived: for life doth her great actions spell.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By what was done and wrought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In season, and so brought<br />
To light: her measures are, how well<br />
Each syllabe answered, and was formed, how fair;<br />
These make the lines of life, and that&rsquo;s her air!</p>
<h4>III.</h4>
<h5>THE TURN</h5>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not growing like a
tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In bulk, doth make men better be;<br />
Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,<br />
To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sear:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lily of a day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is fairer far in May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it fall and die that night;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the plant, and flower of light.<br />
In small proportions we just beauties see;<br />
And in short measures, life may perfect be.</p>
<h5>THE COUNTER-TURN</h5>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, noble Lucius, then for
wine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And let thy looks with gladness shine:<br />
Accept this garland, plant it on thy head<br />
And think, nay know, thy Morison&rsquo;s not dead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He leaped the present age,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possessed with holy rage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see that bright eternal day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of which we priests and poets say,<br />
Such truths, as we expect for happy men:<br />
And there he lives with memory and Ben.</p>
<h5>THE STAND</h5>
<p class="poetry">Jonson, who sung this of him, ere he went,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Himself to
rest,<br />
Or taste a part of that full joy he meant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To have
expressed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this bright Asterism!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it were friendship&rsquo;s
schism,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were not his Lucius long with us to tarry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To separate these twi-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lights, the Dioscouri;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep the one half from his Harry,<br />
But fate doth so alternate the design<br />
Whilst that in heaven, this light on earth must shine.</p>
<h4>IV.</h4>
<h5>THE TURN</h5>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shine as you exalted
are;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two names of friendship, but one star:<br />
Of hearts the union, and those not by chance<br />
Made, or indenture, or leased out t&rsquo;advance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The profits for a time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No pleasures vain did chime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of rhymes, or riots, at your feasts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Orgies of drink, or feigned protests:<br />
But simple love of greatness and of good,<br />
That knits brave minds and manners more than blood.</p>
<h5>THE COUNTER-TURN</h5>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made you first to know
the why<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You liked, then after, to apply<br />
That liking; and approach so one the t&rsquo;other,<br />
Till either grew a portion of the other:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each styled by his end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The copy of his friend.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You lived to be the great sir-names,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And titles, by which all made claims<br />
Unto the virtue; nothing perfect done,<br />
But as a Cary, or a Morison.</p>
<h5>THE STAND</h5>
<p class="poetry">And such a force the fair example had,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they that
saw<br />
The good, and durst not practise it, were glad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That such a
law<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was left yet to mankind;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they might read and find<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Friendship, indeed, was written not in words;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the heart, not pen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of two so early men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose lines her rolls were, and records;<br />
Who, ere the first down bloomed upon the chin,<br />
Had sowed these fruits, and got the harvest in.</p>
<h5>PR&AElig;LUDIUM.</h5>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">And</span> must I
sing?&nbsp; What subject shall I choose!<br />
Or whose great name in poets&rsquo; heaven use,<br />
For the more countenance to my active muse?</p>
<p class="poetry">Hercules? alas, his bones are yet sore<br />
With his old earthly labours t&rsquo; exact more<br />
Of his dull godhead were sin.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll implore</p>
<p class="poetry">Ph&oelig;bus.&nbsp; No, tend thy cart
still.&nbsp; Envious day<br />
Shall not give out that I have made thee stay,<br />
And foundered thy hot team, to tune my lay.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor will I beg of thee, lord of the vine,<br />
To raise my spirits with thy conjuring wine,<br />
In the green circle of thy ivy twine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Pallas, nor thee I call on, mankind maid,<br />
That at thy birth mad&rsquo;st the poor smith afraid.<br />
Who with his axe thy father&rsquo;s midwife played.</p>
<p class="poetry">Go, cramp dull Mars, light Venus, when he
snorts,<br />
Or with thy tribade trine invent new sports;<br />
Thou, nor thy looseness with my making sorts.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let the old boy, your son, ply his old task,<br
/>
Turn the stale prologue to some painted mask;<br />
His absence in my verse is all I ask.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hermes, the cheater, shall not mix with us,<br
/>
Though he would steal his sisters&rsquo; Pegasus,<br />
And rifle him; or pawn his petasus.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor all the ladies of the Thespian lake,<br />
Though they were crushed into one form, could make<br />
A beauty of that merit, that should take</p>
<p class="poetry">My muse up by commission; no, I bring<br />
My own true fire: now my thought takes wing,<br />
And now an epode to deep ears I sing.</p>
<h3>EPODE.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Not</span> to know vice at
all, and keep true state,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is virtue and not fate:<br />
Next to that virtue, is to know vice well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And her black spite expel.<br />
Which to effect (since no breast is so sure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or safe, but she&rsquo;ll procure<br />
Some way of entrance) we must plant a guard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thoughts to watch and ward<br />
At th&rsquo; eye and ear, the ports unto the mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That no strange, or unkind<br />
Object arrive there, but the heart, our spy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give knowledge instantly<br />
To wakeful reason, our affections&rsquo; king:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, in th&rsquo; examining,<br />
Will quickly taste the treason, and commit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Close, the close cause of it.<br />
&rsquo;Tis the securest policy we have,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make our sense our slave.<br />
But this true course is not embraced by many:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By many! scarce by any.<br />
For either our affections do rebel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else the sentinel,<br />
That should ring &rsquo;larum to the heart, doth sleep:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or some great thought doth keep<br />
Back the intelligence, and falsely swears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;re base and idle fears<br />
Whereof the loyal conscience so complains.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, by these subtle trains,<br />
Do several passions invade the mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And strike our reason blind:<br />
Of which usurping rank, some have thought love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The first: as prone to move<br />
Most frequent tumults, horrors, and unrests,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In our inflam&egrave;d breasts:<br />
But this doth from the cloud of error grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which thus we over-blow.<br />
The thing they here call love is blind desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Armed with bow, shafts, and fire;<br />
Inconstant, like the sea, of whence &rsquo;tis born,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rough, swelling, like a storm;<br />
With whom who sails, rides on the surge of fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And boils as if he were<br />
In a continual tempest.&nbsp; Now, true love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No such effects doth prove;<br />
That is an essence far more gentle, fine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pure, perfect, nay, divine;<br />
It is a golden chain let down from heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose links are bright and even;<br />
That falls like sleep on lovers, and combines<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The soft and sweetest minds<br />
In equal knots: this bears no brands, nor darts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To murder different hearts,<br />
But, in a calm and god-like unity,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Preserves community.<br />
O, who is he that, in this peace, enjoys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Th&rsquo; elixir of all joys?<br />
A form more fresh than are the Eden bowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lasting as her flowers;<br />
Richer than Time and, as Times&rsquo;s virtue, rare;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sober as saddest care;<br />
A fix&egrave;d thought, an eye untaught to glance;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, blest with such high chance,<br />
Would, at suggestion of a steep desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cast himself from the spire<br />
Of all his happiness?&nbsp; But soft: I hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some vicious fool draw near,<br />
That cries, we dream, and swears there&rsquo;s no such thing,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As this chaste love we sing.<br />
Peace, Luxury! thou art like one of those<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, being at sea, suppose,<br />
Because they move, the continent doth so:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No, Vice, we let thee know<br />
Though thy wild thoughts with sparrows&rsquo; wings do fly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turtles can chastely die;<br />
And yet (in this t&rsquo; express ourselves more clear)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not number here<br />
Such spirits as are only continent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because lust&rsquo;s means are spent;<br />
Or those who doubt the common mouth of fame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And for their place and name,<br />
Cannot so safely sin: their chastity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is mere necessity;<br />
Nor mean we those whom vows and conscience<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have filled with abstinence:<br />
Though we acknowledge who can so abstain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes a most bless&egrave;d gain;<br />
He that for love of goodness hateth ill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is more crown-worthy still<br />
Than he, which for sin&rsquo;s penalty forbears:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His heart sins, though he fears.<br />
But we propose a person like our Dove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Graced with a Ph&oelig;nix&rsquo; love;<br />
A beauty of that clear and sparkling light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would make a day of night,<br />
And turn the blackest sorrows to bright joys:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose odorous breath destroys<br />
All taste of bitterness, and makes the air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As sweet as she is fair.<br />
A body so harmoniously composed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if nat&ugrave;re disclosed<br />
All her best symmetry in that one feature!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O, so divine a creature<br />
Who could be false to? chiefly, when he knows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How only she bestows<br />
The wealthy treasure of her love on him;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Making his fortunes swim<br />
In the full flood of her admired perfection?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What savage, brute affection,<br />
Would not be fearful to offend a dame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this excelling frame?<br />
Much more a noble, and right generous mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To virtuous moods inclined,<br />
That knows the weight of guilt: he will refrain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From thoughts of such a strain,<br />
And to his sense object this sentence ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Man may securely sin, but safely
never.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>AN ELEGY.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Though</span> beauty be the
mark of praise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yours, of whom I sing, be such<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As not the world can praise too much,<br />
Yet is &rsquo;t your virtue now I raise.</p>
<p class="poetry">A virtue, like allay, so gone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout your form, as though that move,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And draw, and conquer all men&rsquo;s love,<br />
This subjects you to love of one,</p>
<p class="poetry">Wherein you triumph yet: because<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis of yourself, and that you use<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The noblest freedom, not to choose<br />
Against or faith, or honour&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p class="poetry">But who could less expect from you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In whom alone Love lives again?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By whom he is restored to men;<br />
And kept, and bred, and brought up true?</p>
<p class="poetry">His falling temples you have reared,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The withered garlands ta&rsquo;en away;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His altars kept from the decay<br />
That envy wished, and nature feared;</p>
<p class="poetry">And on them burns so chaste a flame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With so much loyalty&rsquo;s expense,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As Love, t&rsquo; acquit such excellence,<br />
Is gone himself into your name.</p>
<p class="poetry">And you are he: the deity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To whom all lovers are designed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That would their better objects find;<br />
Among which faithful troop am I;</p>
<p class="poetry">Who, as an offering at your shrine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have sung this hymn, and here entreat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One spark of your diviner heat<br />
To light upon a love of mine;</p>
<p class="poetry">Which, if it kindle not, but scant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Appear, and that to shortest view,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet give me leave t&rsquo; adore in you<br />
What I, in her, am grieved to want.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
